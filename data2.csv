"2.0","23-Aug-2019","Everything about the physical device, i feel like is pretty well made. Good set up, some minor future issues that are mitigated by screen protectors and similar. Several easy to work with ways to play it, kinda fun in its novelties on its build. My issue? 1) games are ridiculously expensive. So many are over priced. 2) Online play required by Nintendo for a not good service is poor. Especially for things like minecraft. 3) Where are any older games. The games that Nintendo has no need to keep out of the store. The old pokemon, Zelda games, or any games really. Like, great you are putting witcher 3 on there...But not Orignal Zelda and Ocherina of time? Physical? Great! Nintendo online and games? Bad. 1 or 2 games does not make the switch worth buying. PC has better prices, easier to work with, and you can play almost any game out there.","The device is great.

"1.0","03-Apr-2020","I like the Switch Console and even with its quirks, at $299 it's fairly priced and hopefully will be again when the demand goes down.  It's nowhere nearly as powerful as what Playstation and Xbox offer but it's so much more flexible that it can get away with a $300 price tag.  $450 though?  No, not worth it at all.","Good Console at $299.

"5.0","06-Sep-2019","This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)). So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while. I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings. So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime). Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.","Love the Switch - A Casual Gamer's Best Console","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Sherlockian","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_1?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&reviewerType=all_reviews

The newer version gave me 8+ crashes of system and game crashes leading up to finally unable to play this system having to return this system ,what a horrible experience this was.

"5.0","15-Sep-2019","This revised model of the Switch comes with a number of features that I honestly can't fully appreciate as someone who didn't own the previous model. The big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life, even though so far I haven't played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop, but they use the same amount of battery either way I would imagine. The reason I'm giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else. But I pretty much expected as much. I'm sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system, but in case you're wondering here, this one comes with the system, two gray joycons, two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller, a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller, the required cables, and the Switch dock. So you'll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an SD card for reasonable storage space, a pro controller for a more standard controller experience, maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system, an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features... just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself. This will inflate the price further, but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the Switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now. So... basically, if you want a cheaper Switch you'll want to get a Switch Lite and this one will still cost about 300 bucks like the 2.5+ year-old original variant still costs. That is, unless you want to go used. I'm only bringing up these points because while this is a great system, I do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly. Once I realize a Switch was still going to cost the same if I wanted the ability to do on and off TV play I decided I might as well just hop on board with this newer variant. I'd recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model. Otherwise, if price is a concern, wait for the Switch Lite and see how it tickles your fancy. Also, here's tip. If you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode, simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down. Also note that you cannot play on the TV off of the Switch's battery power. The dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function. I hope something in here was helpful.","(New) Nintendo Switch HAC-001(-01)","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Sam Lilly","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_1?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&reviewerType=all_reviews

"1.0","01-Oct-2019","So, I did some research and bought this switch because it is advertised as the 'NEW' model with serial number beginning with 'XKW'. It is said to have better battery life, possibly a boosted processor, and generally just be an updated switch model. That being said, the old discontinued model still retails for the same amount. I checked my model on my 'NEW AND IMPROVED' switch, and it is the sane as my 2018 switch XAW. Needless to say, I am rather disappointed in Amazon. I installed all my games, transferred data, and now I am stuck with wiping and returning it or just settling for a mediocre version of the switch. Thanks for the annoyance Amazon! Also, the left Joy-con bumper was broken right out of the box! It was also covered in grease. $300 for outdated switch, and a broken controller. I don't normally leave nasty reviews, but I'm pretty bummed. Also nintendo will switch out the outdated one, but I have to ship it to them!","Buyer beware; you're in for a rip off.","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+bcKXYDJL._SY88.jpg","Verified Purchase","Abbie","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_1?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&reviewerType=all_reviews

I still don’t get any appeal to Nintendo? We have only had it open for 2 days and already both JoyCons are complete toast. The drift in both is so bad that you can’t make right turns playing Mario Kart. I checked the calibration and followed a number of online tutorials for things to try, but to no avail. Come to find out, there is a class action lawsuit against Nintendo for this very problem. Apparently the solution is to send the controllers to Nintendo and wait a month for them to diagnose and maybe repair them. This is probably why I haven’t thought about the brand Nintendo for almost 20 years since I last owned any of their products. I’ve owned virtually every gaming console created and never once had this issue with any other controllers. If you are so desperate to play outdated video games with Nintendo level quality that enduring this garbage is worth it to you, then more power to you.

"5.0","05-Nov-2019","In terms of raw horsepower (CPU, graphics, whatever) the Nintendo Switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the XBox One.  But, the Switch is a unique device.  As a handheld, it is quite powerful (the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld's battery life, addressing the Switch's greatest weakness).  This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability. Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it.  Software is what makes or breaks a console, no matter how good it is. For example the Zelda game ""Breath of the Wild"" is a visual stunner with a huge open world.  And this is the first portable system that has the full version of Skyrim available for it (the reason I bought it --- a high quality port of Skyrim with the 3 add-on packs).  Nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as ""Mario Kart 8"" as well as a lot of new titles such as ""Super Smash Brothers Ultimate"" or ""Luigi's Mansion 3"". In addition,their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as Stardew Valley. Also, if you purchase the Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20/year) Nintendo also gives you a large selection of NES and SNES classic games.  The membership is worthwhile for that alone. Basically, because Nintendo is ONLY selling the Switch as a current console (the 3DS is on its way out), all of their best software goes to the one console.  And that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well. If you want a wide variety of games, the Switch is a good choice.  If you want THE best console graphics or performance, obviously the Switch isn't for you.","Elegant compromise between handheld and console","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","C.

"4.0","06-Dec-2019","I don’t use this the way that Nintendo advertises; predominantly hand held.  I have the Skull & Company Grip Case attached at all times and only play in handheld mode.  The Switch Lite is too small and doesn’t have the HD rumble like this one has.  This model is the better one with the longest battery life currently available.  This is not designed with comfort in mind for handheld play sessions so the Lite may be a better option if comfort is important.  If you get hand cramps like I do, I highly recommend the Skull & Company grip case.  They also have a great travel case that you can get with it that has plenty of space for the switch with case and joycons attached and space for games, a power adapter and power bank.  It is very good quality and the Switch is dockable with the grip case attached. The switch itself has a much faster, more user friendly, prettier, less congested graphics user interface than all of Nintendo’s previous consoles.  It has a solid state drive for saving and downloading some games, and is expandable with the purchase of Micro SD cards for additional space.  The online store is easy to use and probably the best Nintendo has ever had.  Easy to sort by price, genre, developer.  It is fast and easy to use and you can sort for free games and demos too.  The load time between starting games and between cut scenes in game is very quick on hard drive, sd card, and game cartridge.  Much quicker than nintendo’s previous consoles.  I haven’t played with the joy cons detached so I can’t comment on how responsive the joycons are to movement and player interaction when joycons are detached.  The HD rumble is more subtle than on PS4 and XBox but some games have used it very well.  Mario Odyssey for example has done a great job of blending the environments in some levels to match well with the rumble feedback; its hard to explain, but this feels like the next step in controller evolution and PS5 and NextBox will be adopting a similar tech so more developers should get on board with HD Rumble in future games, hopefully.  The switch buttons have a nice click and feel like they will last, much like most of Nintendo’s products but the stick feels a little looser than the PS4.  I would like Nintendo to tighten that up for the Pro version.  Overall, this is decades of Nintendo engineering in the making which has resulted in, arguably their best console to date.  It is going to shatter console sales records for good reason.  I highly recommend this version of the Switch for the battery life, larger screen and hd rumble, but you may want to get a comfort grip if you will be using it predominantly as a handheld.  I no longer play on my 3DS because this is a much better player experience.","Best battery life, largest screen and HD rumble make this a better buy than the Lite version.","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Chrissy","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","21-Oct-2019","I love my Switch, this console really brings me back to my childhood, there is something about it that recaptured that magic I felt playing my Super Nintendo and even the GameCube. I've played every Nintendo console and while I was a major fan of the early ones, after the Cube, I got sucked into the Xbox 360 and then the PS4, but, this console is the first I've played in years that brings me back to that childhood magic. I got this console on a whim after watching Detective Pikachu and realizing how much I missed Pokémon games, so I had to get Let's Go Pikachu and pre-order Pokémon Shield, as well as getting back into Mario, and checking out Fire Emblem Warriors which is totally amazing.

"5.0","02-Apr-2020","Spent several days during the COVID-19 pandemic searching high and low for a Switch anywhere.  Most of what was available were 3rd party sellers charging $100 to even $200 over market value which is asinine.  Missed a couple stocks at Best Buys that sold out in seconds. Finally I just put on Netflix and had Amazon open and kept refreshing.  Missed a couple then finally had some used listings straight from Amazon for get this, $280! Order was delivered in two days.  Came in original box and had everything in packaging basically like it was new.  Screen had a protrctive film which was cool.  All controllers and adapters were nicely placed in plastic sleeves.  Everything was pretty much flawless.  The only thing is one joy con had barely any battery and the other was dead.  Not a huge deal got it charged in dock quickly. Everything was factory reset and when I started it up it was like it had never been turned on. DON'T BE SCARED TO BUY USED! AND DON'T LET THOSE PRICE GOUGERS TAKE YOUR MONEY! PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE!

Then started to read the reviews and was horrified, but now I'm glad I didn't read those first lol. If I read those first I would have never bought this, now I'm wondering if they bought from 3rd party sellers. So even though it said it wouldn't be in stock for another month,  I still ended up receiving this 3 weeks early.  Now the box wasn't taped like most boxes these days are so I was scared that something was missing. It was a brand new console, no scratches or scruffs. All pieces needed were there and in working order. Setting it up to the tv was a little complicated for me, which made me feel old in my 40s lol. I had ended up missing a step which extremely frustrated me as I don't recall that step being in the  instructions but I probably just didn't see it. The step I had missed was having the console in the dock while setting it up. Once I figured it out it was a cinch lol. If I had seen this step set up would have taken 2 minutes tops to set up.

"5.0","07-Dec-2019","This review is for the Nintendo Switch w/Grey joycons, V2 HAC-001(-01). I've owned the original Switch(HAC 001) and recently, the Switch Lite(Turquoise). Battery life wasn't so good with the original Switch and only a bit better with the Lite. This Switch model has improved battery life, up to 40% depending on brightness settings, volume settings, and the type of game you're playing. Another thing I've noticed is if you download digital games, it takes less time. The graphics(colors) seem to be more vibrant. If you're a gamer who likes to play games on the T.V exclusively, this would be the perfect choice. On the other hand, someone who enjoys gaming on the go, might find it cumbersome carrying this console around. It won't fit in your pocket. Just something to keep in mind. Lastly; if you buy plenty of digital games, a micro sd card of 32-128gb is a must. Another basic necessity would be a glass screen protector, as the plastic screen does scratch easily. There are two models, one with the grey joy cons and one with the red and blue joy cons. The Switch with the red and blue joy cons seems to be the rarer model and is sought after by gamers for it's resell value. There are plenty of games available for the Switch, something for everyone and more to come. If you have your old Switch, it isn't really necessary to upgrade to this newer model. However; just for the improved battery life, I would recommend it.","Nintendo Switch w/Grey joy cons V2 HAC-001(-01)","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R-FaMjL2L._SY88.jpg

"5.0","01-Jun-2020","I want to start by getting the obvious out of the way. Scalpers = Trash, and I cannot believe with everything going on right now that Amazon is allowing them to sell at such inflated prices.  Wait for the official Amazon restocks because they charge MSRP, now onto the Switch. Love it. I cannot say that enough.  The console won't blow you away, but it will keep you entertained for hours. Whether you play in docked mode or handheld mode, they both work very well and looks very good on both screens.  The battery on this generation is much improved over the day 1 release.  The battery itself is the same size, but Nintendo put in a more efficient processor which extends the battery life. The game selection is wide and varied, if you like shooters, you can find them here. If you like platformers, look nowhere else, you have some of the greatest ever made. Not just this generation, but former generations in the Nintendo Eshop. The rundown is the Switch is a great console and worth the $299, just wait until Amazon gets it back in stock, stay far away from this worthless scalpers. Last note: Follow @FatKidAlerts on Twitter, he is always keeping up with Switch stock on Amazon, and that is how I finally got mine for MSRP.","Love the Switch","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Chris S.","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews

This really doesn't look good for Nintendo's quality control seeing that the Switch failed to perform out of the box.  Furthermore, I have had read numerous other stories online of people experiencing the same thing.  Nintendo needs to get better hardware and quality control processes.

"5.0","15-Mar-2020","I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review. The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game. There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo’s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they’re splattering paint all over each other. However the Switch also has its cons. Let’s start with Nintendo’s “E-Shop”. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games. Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony’s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly. All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It’s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it’s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games. 5/5 Stars","It has its pros & cons..but more pros!","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Blake","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","22-Jun-2020","I managed to snatch a retail price Switch away from scalpers somehow.  Which took about two months of attempts to pull off!  Anyways here is my honest assessment after watching repair videos. The Switch is an excellent console at an excellent value (As long as you can obtain one at MSRP).  However being what it is the Switch itself is fairly fragile.  If your child has the self control of Angry German Kid(tm) this would not be the best gift for them.  And if playing it in undocked mode understand by all that is holy that the Nintendo Switch is not a modern smartphone.  There is no water resistance built into the design.  Submerging the switch or even spilling something onto it will likely be the end of the console.  The docking port is another point of fragility.  It won't suffer being slammed into the dock well.  All of the weight of the unit is baring down on that port while docking so being gentle and sorta gingerly easing it down is advised.  The Joycons are also rather fragile.  Not flimsy but they won't tolerate mauling like let's say a PS1 controller could take. That being said I do not think the Switch is cheaply made at all despite these points.  The owner and operator just has to accept that they need to be gentle and they'll be fine.  And I don't mean you need to treat it like a china cup.  But this is NOT the kind of console for a roid rage neanderthal hopped up on Monster drinks and adrenaline.","Before you buy...","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Blimlimlim","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews

"2.0","31-Oct-2020","I'm suppose to love the Switch, but I don't.  I think it's a bad deal overall. 1) Nintendo Online doesn't offer much compared to the Wii virtual console days.  There's no Metroid games from the GC/Wii/Advance era.  Nearly all the games for the switch look like something from the 90's when flash games were popular. But the games are priced as if they're made out of gold. 2) The frame rate on this console is poor. Yeah, some games reach a respectable 30fps, but I'd say most games fall below that. 3) The dock is very woobly, it doesn't lock in, and it's very easy to scratch up the screen. 4) There is no wired connection out of the box.  Why should I have to buy an adapter for that?  If you play online seriously, you use a wired connection. 5) Here's what really bugs me.  There's no web browser on this thing.  No web browser for a mobile device? Are you kidding me?  This also leads to bizarre consequences.  Since there's no reviews on the Nintendo store, you're forced to go to third party sites for reviews... but you can't, because there's no web browser.  LMAO! And I had to create my nintendo account on a PC!  ROFL! Conclusion: I'll stick with the PC, Xbox and Playstation.  If these issues ever get resolved, I'll reconsider.

"5.0","02-Dec-2019","For quite some time Nintendo has been underwhelming when it comes to hardware specs on consoles. To the point that I switched to buying only the handhelds after the Gamecube. With the jump to an Nvidia GPU, not only does the bar for graphics get bumped up significantly from what Nintendo has released recently, it also allows third-party title developers the ability to bring their fun games to Nintendo for releases. Let's state that this isn't as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but still has very good graphics. Not only that, but being able to undock it and play it like a handheld is an awesome feature. Switch Online, a service needed for online gaming, also includes NES and SNES titles you can play for free (included in the price really). My ONE issue, is that chat is needed through an external app. If this is done so the playing experience online requires less bandwidth in the rooms and therefore is smoother on the servers, than it makes sense. Otherwise, seems a bit annoying to have to need another device for it.","Nintendo coming back to greatness","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Owen","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

Interestingly, it also changes the value of the bundle, for example the Animal Crossing colors sell for much higher than the gray, which is higher than the neon colors. - Resolution is nice - Pretty easy to understand and use - Great battery life (make sure to get the 2020 v2) - Modern ports (USB-C) - Software is good and pretty well-designed - Great selection of games CONS: - Apparently keeping it docked can overheat the Switch, so some recommend purchasing an adapter that plugs in to the USB-C port instead of the dock it came with - Speed is a tad slow in opening games and gameplay - Joy-cons are quite non-ergonomic - mitigated a bit by the controller you can dock them in - Easily shows fingerprints/oils and scratches","Not sure it's worth the hype","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Esther","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","31-Jul-2020","I have an loaded opinion on this console that I want to express. The Switch is flawed. As an avid gamer who usually ends up buying all the consoles (except the xbox one) and loves the hardware behind these machines, the switch was super cool when I first heard about it and saw it. I got one not to long after release once they came back to my area. Though it took awhile to save up for any games as during that point in its life, everything was expensive on it and 3rd party devs hadn't moved to it yet. Also there were no media apps on it besides hulu which somehow is still a thing, surprising. But that isn't what I want to talk about, its more how the switch feels really damn cheap. I don't mean cheap as with the plastic shell either (but that is an issue, dislike the texture a lot, and it was also damaged by strong adhesives from dbrand before), but you get a wimpy TN panel for its main built in display, in an era where amoled and ips are very obtainable for device of this size (the original psvita was oled, so it could have been possible). As the resolution is at a solid 720p, which can help balance good enough quality on the go with actual game performance, I feel like they should have opted for a nicer quality screen to have better range of colors, would have created more vivid scenes using sharper and brighter colors. Instead they chose washed out TN panels which leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to any handheld screen semi modern hand held screen with exception of DS's which also chose awful screens. (and some might argue TN for faster response time, and to that, I highly disagree with improvements to other display types, and also for the type of audience the switch aims at) Next I want to talk about the Joycons, as they are lovely little controllers that snap onto the side of the console with a satisfying click. I actually wouldn't have minded them despite being kinda awful when using them on a big screen if they worked correctly, but three years in and these things are still built to fail. There is a major design flaw in them that eventually has the analogue stick wear our and start ""drifting"", making the controller effectively useless. If these were cheap, maybe I wouldn't care as much, but they are 80$ to replace. Sure you can contact nintendo customer support and they sometimes take care of you, but this is a hassle and shouldn't even be a problem. They could have just owned up to the mistake, and redesigned the controllers at this point. ( pro controller is actually a solid design, but its more expensive then both ps4 and xbox one controllers so I dislike recommending it. I believe its the amiibo sensor that does this and that's just bad). Lastly, I kinda wanna just complain about nintendo being nintendo. But before that I want to praise them for how far they did come up to this point. There is finally 3rd party content being pushed on the Switch and thats awesome. It seems like they did listen a bit and made it much easier to get games on the Switch. Ok now onto the bad. The Switch has no utility, and I get that its a gaming console, but still its surprsing that the most mobile and potentially flexible console lacks basic OS features that things like the ps4, psvita, and even 3DS were capable of doing such as, have a variety of streaming services, a basic web browser, and customizing the layout of your home screen/having fun backgrounds. There is no personality to the switch despite it being one of the most unique consoles I have ever seen, which is quite baffling to me. Despite the console featuring bluetooth for its joycons and pro controller, you cant connect bluetooth headphones to it without a 3rd party adapter, which is a little baffling for an on the go console. The UI looks pretty ugly when put onto a big screen, just a personal gripe of mine, I really don't like it. Lastly, the game cartridges are a letdown. The reason games usually feel more expensive on the switch is because they more often then not are. This is due to the game cartridges costing more to make than blu-ray media for the other consoles. Nintendo also didn't want a disparity of cost between physical media and digital media, so if you launch a game both ways, you need to have the price be the same, which creates higher costing digital games on the switch store vs any other platform. The cost of the cartridge also varies depending on size of the game, so larger games will suffer more to this than smaller ones. That's my loaded opinion which turned more into a typed rant on the switch. Its still a pretty ok console that provides a ton of unique experiences that you can't get on any other platform. As a sole console I don't think I would recommend this unless you fully know what you are getting into, but as a side device to play exclusives its not bad. Hopefully they will release new hardware and software updates to fix many of the gripes I rambled on about.","The switch is a unique console that has a lot of good ideas, but is poorly executed.","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Terrorgod","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","06-Aug-2020","I got this Gray version of the Nintendo Switch after a few months of hunting for retail price $299. There's a couple of websites out there that will notify you of in-stock. I happened to be able to grab it off of Amazon, but GameStop, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc, also have them as well. With it being in stock is rare, so you just have to look and be patient! Plan a few months ahead for birthday / xmas gifts so you have time to wait for a retail priced stock is in. Enough about the INSANE price gouging.... I am very pleased with the Switch and am very happy with it. I have played on it for a week so far and everything is working fine and dandy, as it should. One gripe is that the storage capacity is small so only a few games can be played at a time, but with a micro SD card, possibilities are endless. I ordered one of those, and expect it soon so I can expand my downloaded game collection. I've enjoyed the Switch so much I'm getting some additional joycons and a grip and a charging station. I'm going to continue looking for accessories. Maybe a case I also had to get a TV adapter because my old TV only has one HDMI port, so I had to RCA to HDMI it up in order to not unplug and replug my Roku every time I want a bigger screen. How that goes is yet to be determined. I'm still figuring out how the dock station works (TV debacle), but for the most part - no complaints! I haven't played it with more than one person yet, but I'm positive that runs smoothly as well!","Be Patient!","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","HeatherW","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","15-Jan-2020","This review is targeted at newcomers so for veterans of Nintendo products, not much new information here! As for everyone else looking at this gaming system wondering if its right for them, I'll do my best to explain what this model in particular brings to the table. In my particular case a: ""Nintendo Switch with Gray Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)"" Introduction to the system/What is a Nintendo Switch?: The Nintendo Switch is a ""hybrid system"". Lets break it down to its core do understand what people mean by ""hybrid system"", lets start with what is basically a gaming tablet with a plastic screen and a multi-touch-touchscreen. This is the ""Switch itself"" so to speak. For a ""console"", it is EXTREMELY thin in comparison to a PS4 or Xbox One for example. This also means it takes significantly less energy to run. The internal cooling fan is also significantly quieter than either of the prior two other consoles mentioned. That multi-touch-touchscreen allows for certain mobile games like Muse Dash, VOEZ, Deemo, and many others to be ported to the Switch without compromising their touch screen gimmicks from their mobile phone counterparts. Despite this, many of them do have support for button controls. Many Switch games gives you options on how you want to play and this is a running theme with the Switch. Now for the controllers which are ""hybrid controllers"" in a way. For those of you who used the Nintendo Wii, these ""Joy Cons"" share and improved upon the motion controls from the Wii days, except in addition to the motion controls, Nintendo also made the actual button layout resemble a regular controller like the button layout found on a Xbox One controller for example. Not that weird button layout on the Wii for example. This means both the Wii crowd can assimilate into this new generation of Nintendo, along side the core gamers who would prefer a more ""traditional"" controller button set up. Normally a player would use both Joy Cons together as a pair, whether that be attached to the Switch Tablet itself to be played on the go like a 3DS (be it much longer than a 3DS), at home and connected to a plastic grip that gives you those controller ""thighs"" to make it easier to hold and to make it feel more like a more traditional controller even more. You can even use the Joy Cons without them being attached to anything like the Wiimote and Numchuck, but without that annoying wire in between your controllers. This ""detached"" controller style option with the Joy Cons allows you to play in positions otherwise impossible with a more ""static"" controller. For example, you can play with one arm behind your head while the other arm is resting on your stomach as you play from your bed or couch. These Joy Cons also have two buttons on the plastic rails that connect them to the Switch Tablet piece. These buttons are functional and you can actually use just a single Joy Con per player in certain supported games. Key word ""supported games"". This is where the main issue with the Nintendo Switch lies, Nintendo laid the foundation for developers to have the best tools at their deposal but not all of them use them. Some developers have games that cost less overall on the Switch than their original releases on other systems, or from mobile with mobile's atrocious micro-transactions , meanwhile there's other developers that neither have the full game on the physical game cartridges while having the audacity to be more expensive on the Switch. But again, its ALL developer based. Research the game developers in question to see if you're getting the best value for buying their ports (or original) releases on the Nintendo Switch. Oh right, this gaming system uses cartridges. Don't worry, they're not those huge ones from the Nintendo 64 days! They're more Nintendo 3DS sized if anything. If the developer you choose did it properly, a entire game can fit on these cartridges. This means you can play those properly done physical releases immediately without any additional downloads. But again, developer based. Some of them DO only ""partially"" have the game on the Switch Cartridge(s). Do your research. Now to talk about the Dock that connects the Switch Tablet to a TV. If you open up the back side of the Dock, there should be two slits near the bottom of the Dock. The Switch Tablet has two air vents that when ""docked"" should be right up against those vents. Please try not to block off those vents so the Switch Tablet as a easier time cooling itself off while you (and others) play in ""TV Mode"". The Switch Tablet also has a air-vent on the top. So keep that area of the Switch Tablet clear as well. This particular model of the Nintendo Switch, model number ""HAC-001(-01)"", is different from day one Nintendo Switch systems in the sense that Switches with the model number ""HAC-001(-01)"" have better battery life. For example, day one Switches would run really graphically/resource intensive games for about 2 hours 30 minutes (or 2.5 hours) minimum. Whereas this new ""HAC-001(-01)"" numbered Switch(es) can run those games for up to 4.5 hours minimum in ""handheld mode"". The way these ""new Switches"" accomplish this is by having a more efficient component in the inside of the Tablet piece. This also means these new Switches are more energy efficient and less prone to overheating than the day one models. So this is even helpful for people who would use this gaming system for TV use. If you don't have a Switch yet, I recommend this model for its versatility. You never know when you'll change your mind on ""how"" you want to play. I used to use it mostly in TV mode but eventually started using it more and more while outside in general. For example, on the bus, while waiting for something to start whether it be a class, jury duty, meeting, you name it. The Nintendo Switch will make that wait all the less painful. Waiting to be called or dismissed for jury duty especially. Oh, I almost forgot! You CAN use power banks with the Nintendo Switch! The minimum power requirements for a power bank to work with a Nintendo Switch is 5 Volts, and 2.4 Amps. The cable you use to plug the Switch Tablet with a power bank can be found bundled with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Charging Grip. Both of those products come with the USB cable required to use a Nintendo Switch with a power bank. So even if you manage to drain this new Switch's battery life on a long trip, bring a battery bank and you can extend its battery life even further. But again, this mostly won't be needed unless you're on a air ride for over 7 hours or so. Anything less than that, if you're smart about it, you can get away with just the Switch's battery life. Speaking of battery life, the Joy Cons each have a estimated battery life of 20 hours each. Let me repeat that, 20 hours. That brings its competition's controllers to shame! So if you keep your Joy Cons charged overnight (they charge when connected to the Switch Tablet while the Tablet is charging in either the Dock or via battery bank), they ain't going to die unless you deliberately go out of your way not to charge them at least once a week. When their batteries are completely dead, both the Switch Tablet and one pair of Joy Cons takes about 3 hours to fully charge everything. So if you're able to, put the Switch Tablet with the pair of Joy Cons connected to it, and leave the three of them in the Dock overnight to keep everything nice and charged for tomorrows challenges. Get creative, once you get used to the options the Nintendo Switch offers, going to anything else, you'll realize that you'd taken for granted with the Nintendo Switch! In my particular case, using the two Joy Cons in each hand unconnected. I can't do that with a keyboard and mouse! So get your Joy Cons, get them in a position that works for you, get cozy on your couch, bed, etc. and have some fun with your game(s) of choice! Just keep in mind it is a GAMING SYSTEM FIRST, and the ""entertainment media center"" SECOND. So as of January 15th, 2020 don't expect things like Netflix to be on this machine. If you treat it as a DEDICATED gaming system, you're in for one hell of a ride! Just don't forget your screen protector since the Switch Tablet's screen is made of plastic! If you don't want to go through all of them, get this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XDWBPMZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It should serve most peoples' needs. Its durable, cheap, anti-glare, self heals from minor scratches, etc. Its the most value for the price I've found from searching through all of what Amazon has as far as Switch Tablet screen protectors go. As far as the ""system itself"" goes, this is pretty much all of the information that you'd need. Everything else is developer centered, game wise. Do your research, and think very carefully which developers will give you the best bang for your buck!","Has flaws, but overall its a pretty solid system","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Spearra","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

"3.0","08-Jan-2020","On paper this is such a slick device, and combined with great Nintendo titles this was something I was excited for. BUT this system just isn't there yet. Right now I'm dealing with input lag that goes beyond controller or title specific issues. Right from the get go, setting it up (while in portable mode) felt odd. The touch screen and the attached joy-cons felt a bit slow. The input lag was the same speed as my PS4 with my TVs game mode OFF. Not a huge deal for many who will play most casual games, but annoying enough for me that titles like Cuphead and Enter the Gungeon are hindered. I do wonder if the newer portable only version doesn't have these issues, but I'm mainly interested in this as a home console. And it's online component? They still haven't caught up with Xbox Live from the 360 generation. Not a huge problem with Discord around, but still. Lot's of pluses for this system for sure, but this is mainly a message to people to try out the system first and decide for yourself if the input lag is bad enough to ruin your experience. A lot of people are very satisfied and don't even notice. I can see this not being a problem in games like Pokemon, or Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. I've been playing ""The Touryst"", charming, relaxing, and a nice change of pace from what I usually play.","Disappointing for me.","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","CHC","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews

It’s nice to be able to sneak in some gaming time here and there at work when there is some downtime. And I actually find myself playing it in handheld mode pretty often at home when I’m watching football on the weekends. I’m glad I waited until this model with the improved battery life came out. Sometimes, I don’t have to put it on the dock to charge for 5 or 6 days, assuming I’m playing 30 minutes here and there.

"5.0","27-Jan-2020","This is, strangely enough, the first portable system I have ever bought in my 30+ years of gaming. I’ve actually bought 2 Switches so far. The first one was a Christmas present for my son who I was trying to ease into video games. He loves it. After him having it for a year and me occasionally playing it to help him through areas where my greater experience with games could help get through certain areas, I was tempted to get one for myself to play when I had long periods of downtime at work. When Witcher 3 came out for the switch, I bought another one for me and have been playing it a few times per week since. My experience with the console is pretty much strictly in the handheld mode. I bought a Satisfye grip and case for my switch which allows me to hold the system more comfortably than I would without it. Holding the standard system and playing for more that 20 minutes or so causes my hands to cramp. The small joycons are just too small for adult male hands to use for long without some discomfort. I’m fine with that since the small size makes the system easier for kids, like my son, to use. A regular controller can be a bit bulky for a grade school age kid to use well. With the case and grip, this system is perfect for me to throw into my vehicle at work and forget about it until things slow down when I’m waiting for a call. Then I can break it out and pass the time in style. All in all, I have no complaints about the system, my son loves it and uses it constantly. I like it for its portable nature and surprising computing power. It is the first portable system I’ve experienced that didn’t feel like a downgrade or gimmick. The Switch instead feels like a true portable version of a larger console like PS4 or XB1. I still play on my PS4 far more than I do the Switch, but I can’t take that system to work and play in the office or car. If you have young kids, or a desire to game on the go with something better than your phone, then it’s hard to go wrong with the switch.","Great for younger kids or mobile gaming.","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","J.

"3.0","29-Dec-2019","The game system we received is the newer one with better battery life. However, we've been disappointed with the joys cons. Both right joy cons in the included one and another set we bought would disconnect. If you read online there are all kinds of issues with the joy cons ever since they made the system. There are fewer problems since they updated them, however, the joy cons we received with this system are dated 2017, before they updated them. So, new game system, old joy cons. Seriously disappointed in this. Nintendo is in the process of setting up a warranty repair, but I shouldn't have to do this for a brand new system. The individual set we bought is going back and we purchased new ones in a local store that should theoretically be newer. To initiate the repair Nintendo asked about a hundred questions and 2 hours later the repair is accepted. Not a good setup, in my opinion.","Game system is great but joy cons are a disappointment","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","T.

"4.0","08-Jan-2020","I bought this system for myself as a birthday present, and I have enjoyed using it!  The controllers took a bit getting used to detaching on and off properly.  I think the main thing is to be careful about what games you buy if the device will be worth it to you in the end, or if you are excited about upcoming games.  I waited to purchase the Switch until I knew there were about ten games I wanted to play and added about three of them into the in initial cost as well.  I’m pretty picky about my games because I am a casual gamer. Zelda breath of the wild—which I borrowed from my brother later— is more intensive than anything I have played in YEARS. Games are expensive in physical format, although that is my preference.  There are some cheaper games on the online store.  So far my favorite local game shop does not have any used copies of Switch games although they have everything else.  Maybe some day. I might buy a screen protector for it in the future but have not as of yet.  If your Switch is to see heavy use by an entire family or if as an owner you plan to travel with it I’d recommend one but that is not the case for me. I did have a problem within a month of ordering the machine where the fan started whirring LOUDLY.  At first only when it was plugged in to charge then all the time when it was at rest, then at last even while playing a game.  I called Nintendo customer service and had it repaired (although I had to send it back three times with the same issue to a radioshack in Syracuse NY.  Last time I sent it in they just replaced the system.) If I have a problem in the future I will request replacement rather than repair, especially if it’s going back to New York.  Just not happening.  At least customer service was good, but I was becoming a bit disgruntled toward the end there with their techs!  For my troubles customer service gave me a new set of controllers automatically and then later, three months free on the eshop.  Oh, and the second and third shipments were two day free.","Bit of a rocky start but good for now!

"5.0","23-Sep-2020","Similar to other Nintendo systems, innovation is always attached to their new ideas. The joy cons are similar to the wii remotes, albeit not as precise for some games where they were used for shooting type games, the joy cons are incredible for multiplayer. I honestly prefer using one joycon whenever I can when playing games, it's really nifty being able to play two player automatically with a friend or family member without having to pay for an expensive controller, or a cheaper built one. Nintendo Apps are so-so at the moment, it would be great to have streaming apps such as Netflix for streaming, but other apps such as Youtube have worked well streaming but I do not like the interface for searching for videos. When playing online, after paying for a year subscription, was not as bad as the days of the Nintendo Wii, but it could be better. Wifi play has always been a struggle for companies and consumers that I don't expect to go away with any patch made by Nintendo. Buying the year subscription also includes many nes/snes games you can play with the joy cons in single/multiplayer. My roommate got rehooked playing super mario world and it was a blast seeing someone who says they ""hate games with bad graphics"". Overall, if you're looking for a system for on the go or for a house hold device, the Nintendo Switch is a excellent system with a good range of games to play on. My young nephew and kid siblings are a fan of it; and same for me and several of my friends who are in our early 20s.","Great overall system for gaming with friends!","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Chester","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","07-Mar-2020","The only time I’ve used a Switch has been playing on one that my friends own. Just these experiences has really intrigued me into getting my very own Switch. I love playing video games and I own an Xbox and PS4, so I figure at some point it was time to complete the trifecta. While I’m more of an Xbox person, I will say I am very impressed by the Switch. It is a very simple console, but genius in of itself. I’ve had some Nintendo gaming devices here and there. A SNES back in the day, but mostly their portable ones from the Gameboy to the Advanced to the DS and 3DS. The Switch combines that of a home console and a portable gaming device and for that I love it. I can put it in the dock and play it on my TV. I can play it handheld which will be great for road trips or maybe just wanting to play anywhere. This was a brilliant move by Nintendo and it makes the Switch really stand on its own. Now what I’d say my favorite thing about the console is it’s simplicity. This device is made for one thing only and that is for playing video games.

The reviews were pretty glowing for the Switch and I can say they’re warranted. Just make sure you buy the newer generation (this product) so you have better battery life and less decline over the life of the product. I love how Nintendo the Parental Controls essentially live within an app on the parent’s phone. A motivated kid can hack just about anything so keeping these settings non-local is a brilliant little safeguard. My kids have to ask me for “more time” when they’ve hit a daily limit (which is customizable for the day of the week). It’s very much like a simpler, more reliable version of Apple’s Screen Time feature on iPhones. Of course, you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code. It’s also worth mentioning that Nintendo did a great job with the “user assisted driving” feature on Mario Kart that helps young kids and inexperienced gamers be competitive.

"5.0","06-Dec-2019","This is the version you want HAC-001(-01). Runs cooler and battery life is way better.  I would also say the color on the screen is warmer than my older version. The Switch has been my favorite Nintendo console since the SNES. Tons of great games on the system and a lot of classics.  Having access to games on the go is fantastic.  I play my Switch docked a lot as well and looks good even on my 4k TV. It doesn't have the graphic level of a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X but I find I play this more than either of those consoles.  Also from a family standpoint, the kids love playing together in Smash Bros and Mario Kart. We have a lot of fun all around with it. I let my kids take over my older one. I added parental controls at that point. This is actually available on all models of the Switch and can be controlled from an app on my phone.","Best verision of the Switch so far","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","TheBlueGrassCat","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","13-Jan-2020","I'm mainly going to list off the pros for this unit, something I like that they did on this generation compared to the other consoles by Nintendo and some gripes. Portability obviously with its docking capabilities - very good move.  The way the Switch locates itself within the dock is a cool party trick.  I like not having to have a rucksack full of gear just to bring my system with. The Joy-Con controllers are passable and you can actually play 2P games with each one.  I do wish they offered a Pro-controller bundled version. The setup of the system is easy, you don't have to fill out another mortgage worth of EULAs to play. For pennies you get a slew of NES and SNES games through Nintendo Online. Mario Maker 2 is pretty fun and I wished more games had BYO levels like it (cue the wave of gamers that will correct me on 20+ games that have their own world-building options. I'm 43 and don't have time for games like I did in my teens.  Let me dip my filthy casual toe back in the game pool now that my kids are grown.)","It's Nintendo's newest generation console - you know what this is.","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Svartgotik","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","24-Jan-2020","I knew people who owned the Switch were seemingly all very happy with it, and I planned on getting one at some point. When Pokemon moved to the Switch, ""some point"" became ""right now"". Nintendo likes to make their consoles unique. The DS Lite had two screens, a touch screen, and a microphone that were all used to make the experience unique. The 3DS, The Wii, and Wii U also had their own interesting elements. At times, it just felt gimmicky. The Switch on the other hand, doesn't feel that way at all. It's the gaming equivalent of a laptop with a docking station. You can have the TV experience like any other console, which is also great for party games. Then you can take it with you. This is basically THE go to gaming device for plane rides. The joycons are also genius. It is just incredibly versatile. I'm pleased that it has USB C. The Dock is easy to connect to as it literally just drops in place. I do think it could use more apps. it pretty much only has Hulu and YouTube at the time of this review, if I'm remembering correctly. I am a bit of a geek so I have plenty of other devices to watch on, but if it wants to compete with some of the other devices, it would be nice to have the option of watching Netflix, for example. I remember when the Wii first came out, and you'd go play the sports games with whoever had one. The novelty wore off before long. The Switch however, is here to stay.

At first I didn’t have enough to buy any physical games so I bought some games for sale on the E shop. And it worked great! But only till after the return date passed did I realize, the game card reader was broken! When I first played one of the games it seemed to work fine. But later when I removed the game and I inserted it again, it told me it couldn’t read the game card. Easy enough, just restarting the switch made it read. But now months have past and the only game card it seems to read is animal crossing. All my other games just wont read. Even a brand new copy of Minecraft.

"5.0","02-Jun-2020","This was my first hand held gaming device and I think it is a very unique, innovating what a portable console should be. I love the portability of it on the go and the ability to allow multiple players play at once. For $300 I think this is a solid gaming console that can be used to pour hundreds of hours into and still find games refreshing. The Nintendo game lineup also has the best exclusives out of the other competitors, from Mario to Zelda to Animal Crossing, there’s a game that suits anyone’s taste. Of course there are improvements to be made such as the joycons being small and sometimes uncomfortable in the even if you put it in together like a controller, it still doesn’t replace the feeling of a real full sized controller. In the future, I would just like Nintendo to make the portable screen 1080p with a 120hz refresh rate for an even better gaming experience.

What most people don't realize is that consoles are in high demand this year (2020) and we all know the reason so I can't fault a company for increasing the price on item due to high demand and low stock of said item. That being said Mums Collectibles & Stuff is by far the cheapest I have seen a new switch go for on amazon, ebay or a number of other websites. On top of all of this one I bought the item from them they had it ready and shipped the next day as I did buy it rather late at night. With an estimated arrival time of 2 weeks I actually received it a week early which I give my thanks to UPS. When I opened the package I found they took the time to make sure that the switch was secure and safe with two layers of massive bubble wrap which was just extra enjoyment.

"5.0","01-Oct-2020","If you’re willing to wait, Amazon occasionally gets some, and puts them up at regular price.  Received mine much sooner than their initial estimate. As for the console... it’s fun, everyone knows that. Great first-party games, and a nice selection of third-party games. Okay battery, unusual but feature-packed controllers, and a tiny bit uncomfortable for extended play in handheld mode. Less powerful than its competitors, but ray tracing does not a good game make. Just do everyone a favor and don’t pay a scalper for the console. That’s the only way to choke them out. Stay patient and check multiple stores, regularly. Eventually you’ll find one at the proper price.

Even though it was overpriced, I understand that it is due to low supply due to the pandemic so I am not that upset about it as the console has been working perfectly and came with everything advertised. The only problems I ran into were low memory and short battery life on the device but those were easily fixed. The seller was also very helpful and the switch arrived much earlier than expected and on my birthday, coincidentally. Definitely worth its original price ($299) and even though the rise in price is disappointing and definitely pricey, I would argue that its also somewhat worth it.

Animal Crossing New Horizons, super smash bros, and Mario Kart 8.  I love how Nintendo is more parent friendly games, you don't have to worry about the games your kids are playing on Nintendo Switch so much compared to say games on other consoles with adult ratings and such.. Love that most 2 player games can be played with one joy con, (although a second joycon is on our to buy list)  the reason being is adult hands holding half a joycon is kind of hard.  If you can grab one at retail and are in the market, i'd say go ahead and pull the trigger.

"5.0","27-May-2020","I've been wanting a switch for a long time, and finally managed to get my hands on one close to MSRP (at $307) during the pandemic. I only have one game on it so far, but to say I'm pleased and impressed so far is a bit of an understatement. It's nice to be able to play on my TV in the living room, and when someone else wants to play their own game or watch Netflix, I can just take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode, but stay in the same room and socialize. I like being able to bring the game into my room and not be forced to play it in the living room if I don't want to deal with all the noise. It's pleasant to hold, with just a bit of weight to it to feel sturdy. The Joycons are nice to the touch, although the sticks are a little too 'smooth' for my liking so I put some grips on. I haven't experienced any drift, yet, but it's only been a few days. They're very satisfying to hold, and even more satisfying to click into place on either the tablet or the included joy-con grip. I haven't tried the straps yet. The screen is lovely, and the speakers are front-facing so it seems louder than other handhelds. It IS a little frustrating to adjust the volume while I have it on the kickstand. The kickstand is a pain to pull out, and isn't sturdy in the slightest. Overall I'm very, very happy with it. I can't wait to get more games on it and play with friends.","Purchased 'used', feels like new.","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BBkYMMTmL._SY88.jpg","Verified Purchase","Sarah Murray","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews

Not many downsides, There's lots of games to play on here since the switch has been out for a while and it doesn't even have to be connected to a tv to let you play.

"3.0","25-Dec-2019","The switch is a great game system but my blue joy-con broke within a couple days of playing with it. It was very disappointing as I bought it for my son’s birthday so I waited about a month before giving it to him. Of course, that meant I could not return it once the controller broke. We had planned a big road trip and I was hoping the switch would keep him entertained but because of the broken controller, it was useless the whole time. Nintendo has a warranty on it, but being holiday season I haven’t gone through their “process” of returning it and getting a new one. All I can say is its been a very disappointing experience with this Nintendo product delivered by Amazon. Just sucks something so expensive can break so easy.","Be Careful, Joy-Con breaks easily","Style: Console Color: Neon Blue and Red HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","24-Dec-2019","When I was little I used to be able to spend all day playing games. Of course as I got older, my amount of free time decreased exponentially. If, like me, you need to balance your job and college life but still want to play games, this console is a really great choice. It's loaded with tons of pick-up-and-play games that are great for quick 30 minute sessions. The handheld mode makes it really accessible and portable, and the new model has a great battery life. My only big complaint is that the controllers when in handheld mode don't always feel securely attached to the sides of the console. There is a small amount of wiggle if you move the console that is not really enough to bog down the experience, but is still noticeable enough to feel sort of cheap. Overall though this is a great console for a busy young adult still trying to find time for their favorite hobby and I highly reccomend it if you're interested.","Great Console for a Busy Life","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","","Verified Purchase","Amazon Customer","Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy‑Con - HAC-001(-01)","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/product-reviews/B07VGRJDFY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews

When I am tired and no longer want to sit at the TV and play, I grab it and jump in bed and just continue. My only issue is quite technical: the resistance of the Joycon controller buttons is too high. Takes too much effort to press them down. I got a pro controller and the difference is astounding.

"4.0","24-Sep-2020","I’ve had my Switch for about a year now and I can say it’s a very fun console. It’s no where near as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox but the fact that I can take my games on a road trip or play it at home is pretty awesome and convenient for gamers. The Joy-Cons do get loose however over time and will slide off without having to press the release button so I would recommend getting a grip or a case like the picture shown above. Another thing I wan to mention is the joy con drift, which can get really annoying at times. Having to calibrate them in the settings menu every other minute can be really annoying and for others, ruin the experience. I usually use a pro controller while playing on docked mode and I don’t run into any issues but the problem persists when I’m playing on table top or handheld. Besides the minor inconvenience here and there, I think the Nintendo Switch is great, especially with third party games like Skyrim or the Witcher 3 being ported over to the Switch. It’s a great little console.","One Year Later as a Switch owner","Style: Console Color: Gray HAC-001(-01)","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rxADVctCL._SY88.jpg

It has a lot of games for me to enjoy, a lot of games for non-gamers to enjoy, and games that entire groups can enjoy. It feels like the best console I've ever owned. Between the Nintendo 1st party titles like the amazing Zeldas (Breath of the Wild and Link's Awakening) the many top-notch indie games that are flooding the Nintendo shop (Gris, Transistor, Indivisible) - I'm a content gamer. I have a PS4 and would play their amazing library of games intermittently. However, the Switch's library has caused my game time to exponentially increase.

I couldn’t find any games I was really into or anything that seemed worth my time. I got the Switch after having seen my friends using it and after a few minutes of playing Breath of the Wild. Let me tell you.... this system is wonderful!! You’re really getting two systems in one!! Being able to play on the go as well as just plug and play is such a wonderful concept. Not to mention the game options and variety. I’ve played over 70 hours of Breath of the Wild, and loved it. The other indie games available are also great additions. Overall, it’s a great system.

"5.0","03-Apr-2020","I bought this just to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and it didn't disappoint in the least! It's incredibly fun! One cool feature is that if you set up Parental Control using the free app, it will tell you how long you've played each day. Since I'm neither a parent nor do I need to be controlled, I disable restrictions and play-time limit so it doesn't actually interfere when I'm playing, but it is a bit sobering to see that yesterday I played for 6 hrs and 40 min. Also, if you set the play-time limit to 0 min everyday, the console will prompt you to disable Parental Control via a PIN. This could come in very handy if you have a sibling or roommate who likes to steal your Switch. I would also recommend getting a screen cover, either plastic or glass. I have a glass one that adheres like a second screen and haven't had any trouble yet, but then again I've only had it for 8 days and treat it very carefully.

"5.0","07-Aug-2020","I bought this Nintendo Switch from this Seller. It was an Extra $145.00 than the original Retail Price of $300.00, but I believe that was because of the Switch Shortage that happened everywhere due to COVID-19. The actual Product I received was top notch though. It was packaged very well. I didn't have a problem opening it which I have had with some other Products which actually lead to me accidentally damaging those items. But no such problem here. The actual Switch itself was also in perfect condition. No scratches anywhere on any of it. And nothing was missing. It runs perfectly fine too. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. I am very happy with it. The only downside, like I said, was the Price, but is understandable given the Pandemic and Shortage. So I'm giving this Five Stars.

A quick note on the parental control application which is also very practical and which lets you know how long players are using the console per day.
