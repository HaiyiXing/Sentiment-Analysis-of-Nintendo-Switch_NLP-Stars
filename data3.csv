"5.0","22-Sep-2019","Gave it 5 stars because there is nothing wrong as described, but parents may want to read this: I have two kids and we already own the original Nintendo Switch and have amassed over 40 games throughout the 2.5 years since the Switch's release. The Switch Lite although nothing physically wrong with it, is completely useless to me and my family. I have two young kids, and all 3 of us have our own profiles which are linked under my main account via Nintendo ID. The problem is is that only the main account holder (me) can play the purchased games on both devices. So the Switch Lite does not work for either of my kids, only my main account. Yes, this can be switched by changing which Switch device is the ""primary"" switch, but the fact still remains that under NO conditions can my kids play both switch consoles at the same time, even if it is two separate games. If you have cartridges instead of digital downloads, you will not have this problem. I just fail to understand Nintendo's logic with this. I understand that they are trying to protect their own content from unauthorized use, but in doing so are rendering their newest device completely useless to customers like me. I will be returning.","PARENTS BEWARE: This could be useless to you too!","Color: Turquoise Style: Lite Console","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715IVQ0HlJL._SY88.jpg

"1.0","21-Sep-2019","I strongly recommend AGAINST buying the Switch Lite. Downloaded content can only be played while connected to the internet. HUGE downside and problem since this is meant to be portable!!!

"3.0","20-Sep-2019","Basically a budget friendly Nintendo Switch that's meant to be more portable. Unlike the iphone 11 and iphone 11 Pro, Galaxy 10e and Galaxy 10, iphone XR and iphone X, etc it doesn't keep all features the same, just downgraded. In fact like the Nintendo 2DS (compared to 3DS) it actually takes away some features. If you already own a Nintendo Switch console, you can sync* or transfer from your profile/games/saves using your Nintendo account. Very simple; when you boot up system for first time it'll walk you through it step-by-step *If you sync or link one account to multiple switch consoles, the non-main one has to verify every few hours to play downloaded games which can be a hassle if you don't have internet connection Let's go through the list of changes: 1. Size, weight, portability Overall size in general: The Switch Lite is basically the Original Switch (I'll be referring it to 'Switch' moving forward) but with one of the joy cons detached. You think this will be more portable, but in practice from my personal experience it's not. If you consider size only The Switch can detach joycons for better storage. Downside is that you must be aware where you put the screen and joycons and attach them later. There is a difference if you pocket thing whole thing without detaching i guess Seeing the smaller size, there may be more hand cramping involved if you have giant adult sized hands Switch Lite is lighter in weight, but it's not a night-and-day difference. Not going to tell unless you have both side-by-side in each hand. Bezels are colored which is nice. It's not black like on the Switch, so able to distinguish where the screen ends 2. No detachable joycons Cannot detach joycons, making the logo snap/click sound clip that game trailers start off/ends with absolutely useless when referring to Switch line of systems in general. As one singular unit, fused into the system; feels more solid in the hand compared to original Downside is that it loses some functionality in some games You are not able to split controllers to let a friend play Some games that you can't play on Switch Lite out of the box (as of this review) are: 1-2 Switch Fitness Boxing Just Dance (Series) Nintendo Labo (Series) Nintendo Lano VR Ring Fit Adventures Super Mario Party Surgeon Simulator There are also other games that's not as convenient to play in handheld only like: ARMS Fortnight Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Mario Tennis Aces Pokemon Let's Go series Super Mario Odyssey Splatoon 2 Zelda Breath of the Wild You can buy joy cons to play on Switch Lite, but that costs additional $70 MSRP. Might as well buy a Switch at that point If the thumb sticks breaks or if there are drifting issues, you can have it fixed by Nintendo for $80. 3. Cannot be docked to TV, no kick stand No docking station. If you own the Switch with docking station; the Switch Lite cannot fit in it. As of right now, there's no official docking station for Switch Lite from Nintendo, and no 3rd party adapters No kickstand to play on tabletop mode. Seeing the smaller screen you wouldn't want to anyway even when a lot of controllers are sync and people squinting their eyes when huddled around the system 4. Has a D-Pad. Best feature of the system in my opinion. Better tactile feel when playing. Enhances gameplay especially when playing 2D fighters D-pad and other buttons (ABXY, shoulder buttons) are more muted when pressed which is great when playing in a public setting 5.  No IR, HD Rumble The IR Motion Camera and HD rumble features have been removed. Games that support these features will not work on Switch lite 6. Better battery?? 4-7 hours versus the 3-6 hours of the original launch Nintendo Switch. If you buy the newer 2019 model of Switch (Retail box with a lot of Red), the battery life is better than the Switch Lite 7. New colors Comes in Turquoise, Grey and Yellow There's also a Pokemon Sword and Shield ( Zacian and Zamazenta) Edition edition 8. Smaller screen 5.5 vs 6.2 inch screen Resolution is the same at 720p, but more compact making it appear sharper with a 267ppi vs 236ppi Overall, I like the concept of a more portable (?), affordable switch, but I don't like the fact that it exists. If it's like the 2ds (with no 3d support). Devs (even first party) will eventually take away features in games in the future: motion controls, AR support, HD rumble, docked TV mode, etc to cater to a wider audience. They should have just made it smaller and kept everything the same Good buy for those budget friendly, but if you like more options best to go for the upgrade if you can afford it.","List of Changes Compared to (Regular) Nintendo Switch","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","","Vincent","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm1?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","21-Sep-2019","For those who use/will use the Switch exclusively as a handheld device, I would recommend this system over the original Switch! Here are some things I've noticed in comparison to the original Switch so far: - The Switch Lite is far more comfortable to hold and and use than the original Switch thanks to its smaller size and ' lite'er (hahaha) weight. I can hold this small boi for a lot longer than the larger Switch before having to put it down to rest my hands. - All the buttons have that superior Gameboy Advance button feel, ie: they don't feel a tad too rigid and clicky like those in the larger Switch. Plus there is an actual d-pad here. The system is made of plastic and has a sort of coarse feel to it. It won't slip out of your hands too easily and feels nice to the touch. - Screen size is a bit smaller- 5.5 inches vs the Switch's 6.2 inches, but this ties into the greater ease of use as a handheld as mentioned before. In terms of brightness and display quality I cannot say that I see any large differences. It's possibly a bit better since it's the same 720p but in a smaller screen? Anyway it looks great just like the original (and requires a screen protector just like the original.) - The color schemes for this system are some of the best Nintendo has ever offered in my opinion. The yellow one that I got looks fantastic and I'm glad that I chose this over the turquoise and the Pokemon themed one. - Sound output is slightly lower in terms of volume than the original Switch. This is probably because the speakers are on the underside of the system as opposed to the front. This is a minor thing though, you'll still hear your games well enough. - The battery looks to be draining at a similar or slightly slower rate that the original (release day) Switch. However keep in mind that the newer shipments of the original Nintendo Switch are supposed to have a larger battery life. - You will of course be missing out on a number of features: no docking to the TV/monitor, no detachable controllers, no HD rumble or IR camera, no kickstand. However as mentioned before this a pure handheld, and I believe it serves that purpose better than its larger brethren. For anyone who already owns a Switch and is interested in this system, it's a no-brainer. The Switch Lite is maybe the best handheld made by Nintendo so far. If you are choosing between the Switch Lite and the original Switch however, the decision becomes more difficult. I play most Switch games in handheld mode. If I had to choose between one of these today, I would probably choose the Switch Lite. If you like playing games on a larger screen, or you play local multiplayer games (Super Smash Bros. comes to mind) you probably should go with the original Switch. You'll have a lesser handheld experience, but you'll also be getting some really great features that you'd miss out on with the Switch Lite.","The better Nintendo Switch for handheld mode","Color: Yellow Style: Lite Console","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ajB176bBL._SY88.jpg

"4.0","20-Sep-2019","Here we have the Switch Lite, for those who are ready to ditch the TV and make your Switch entirely a portable device. Let's talk about that for a moment. This is an entirely portable device, just a tiny bit larger than a Vita (for the seven of you who have one of those), and with a screen about the size of the average smart phone. The form factor is definitely smaller than that of the regular Switch, and it's much lighter. It's really very comfortable to use. The JoyCons are no more. They still exist, in the sense that you can have external ones attached to this baby, but the system has a pair built in. Now with external ones, you could probably play some two player games together, but honestly I don't much see the point. The screen quality is excellent. Breath of the Wild and Smash look amazing. The games play well, too. It takes a hot second to get used to the controls, but once you're there, you're golden. The sound quality is also very good. The one complaint that I have about the system is the same complaint we've all had about Nintendo in general for years: the online component. I have two X Box 1 S systems (don't ask why), and with those, my game saves, and downloaded games are easily available on both systems. I don't even have to really put any effort into it. With the Switch and Switch Lite, it's different. You have to go through several annoying steps in order to make it happen, and even then, you have to set up one as your primary system and the other as the secondary (I haven't been able to figure out how to do this yet). That complaint aside, and it isn't a small complaint, I'm quite pleased. It's another worthy handheld for Nintendo!","Mostly impressed","Color: Turquoise Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Kit Swanson","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm1?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&reviewerType=all_reviews

"2.0","21-Sep-2019","Do not buy this as a second switch especially if you are using family sharing. You will be forced to purchase second copies of games. We returned our purchase after an hour of stumbling through the lack of sharing options. Via polygon: The lack of any kind of family sharing for games, or even just a robust digital rights system is a huge roadblock. You can use the same digital game on multiple Switch units, but any Switch that isn’t the user’s primary system has to connect to the internet to give you permission to play games, which isn’t always an option for a portable device on the road or in the air. The only other option is to buy physical copies of your games, which means that if one member of the family leaves the house with the cartridge, no one else can play. If Nintendo wants to launch an ecosystem of hardware to entice families to buy multiple Switch units — which would be ideal — it needs to figure out better ways for those consoles to communicate and share content. Other platform holders have figured out ways around this limitation, even though the issue isn’t nearly as pressing on hardware that stays in one place, which makes Nintendo’s inability to deal with the situation even more baffling. The company always has a way of making problems that have been solved on other platforms seem insurmountable, and the trend continues with the lack of any kind of family sharing plan for games on the Switch and Switch Lite.","Excellent hardware, horrible OS for sharing","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Peter","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm1?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&reviewerType=all_reviews

Even though its lighter, it feels more solid as the joycons do not come off, and it doesn't bend like the old one did.  My arms don't get tired at all holding this.  AND it had an actual D-pad!

"1.0","20-Sep-2019","This system was ordered with eagerness and opened as soon as it arrived. It will not accept any memory cards. Continuous error messages. Tried with multiple cards, reformatted, nothing works. Nintendo support did some basic troubleshooting and told me it had to come in for repair. I cannot recommend anyone purchase this system at this point. I will update my review if and when they fix the issue. For now I am stuck waiting on a repair for a system I was unable to use. Full disclosure : I am a die-hard Nintendo fan and have owned every system including the Virtual Boy. I have Nintendo systems from the 90s that still work fine. Something is broken with the Switch lite software. UPDATE- 10/16/2019 : the repair has been with Nintendo for over 3 weeks now, and they can't seem to find it. It may be lost internally (they have admitted ownership of it as tracking confirms it was received). Now have to wait at least another week for an investigation. Had my system for minutes before it broke - now Nintendo looks like they will take over a month to 'fix' my issue. Will continue to post updates. UPDATE 10/21: They 'found' the system and it is 'in service' - they say I should get a tracking # within the next 5 days - so we are looking at a 5-6 week repair window. Will report back when the actual device is in-hand. UPDATE: 10/25. System is back in-hand. It threw a bunch of error messages when I fired it up but finally updated and now works. I sent in a 'new' system and received back one that had residue, fingerprints, and scuff marks on the case. Not happy. Nintendo offered me a 6-month window to return to fix the cosmetic case issues - I don't feel like waiting another month for a 'new' system, so I am going to see if an error message pops up in my use over the next few days. This process has been very painful and I can't suggest getting a Switch Lite given the experience I had. The system appears to be working and seems pretty neat - will update with impressions once I've clocked some time in it. UPDATE 2: 10/25: System is regularly, if not consistently, failing to recognize the memory card. Out of 5 power cycles, it did not recognize the card on 3 of them. System is going back to Nintendo for another round of repairs. I've asked them to replace the system since it came back with cosmetic blemishes in addition to it having the same problem. Will continue to update this review. Don't buy this system. UPDATE 3: 11/27:  Nintendo replaced the system and it works fine. Loving the system so far. I understand that lemons happen - but Nintendo's TWO MONTH turnaround earned them that 1 star. The device, that now works, is very enjoyable.

"2.0","26-Sep-2019","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The Switch Lite was my first Switch ever. I've always wanted one, and when the Lite was announced for 100 dollars less than the OG model, I knew it was finally time to bite the bullet. I pre-ordered it, got it on Day 1, and played it... a lot. And you know what? It was amazing. Everything positive you hear about these little guys is 100% correct. However, weird stuff started happening in my games after a few days. My character in Mario Kart would randomly turn right, and my fighters in Smash Ultimate would do the same. I did some Googling to see what the problem was... and you probably already know what I'm going to say next. I had it. The infamous ""Joy-Con Drift"". I had it on my left analog stick 5 days after receiving my Lite. (Background info: ""Joy-Con Drift"" is a pervasive issue that exists with current Switch controllers, where the analog sticks will start moving things in game by themselves, even without any input from the player. This is due to a fundamental problem with the components inside every analog stick. Unfortunately, every Joy-Con has the potential to drift, sooner or later. And as many tear-down videos on Youtube will demonstrate, the Switch Lite analog sticks are made from the exact same parts as the Switch OG analog sticks) You have no idea how disappointed I am. I know I can return and exchange my Lite for another one, but do I really want to? It's very likely that my next unit will develop the same problem. Maybe I'll be luckier and NOT have it happen in the first week of play, but it is likely to happen a few months, or a year down the line. When that happens, I won't have Amazon's return policy to serve as a parachute, and I'll have to send the entire thing to Nintendo directly. It's just a huge headache. But you know what? I really loved the Switch over the 5 days that I had it. I think that speaks volumes about the quality of the platform and the games, and I don't want to stop playing. In the end, I decided to return my Lite and get an ""new-and-improved"" regular Switch. Now, I know it's just as susceptible to the Joy-Con issue, but it's a lot easier to send a single Joy-Con than an entire Switch Lite, and Nintendo have already announced that they will repair Joy-Cons completely for free. That being said (and it breaks my heart to say this), I can't recommend the Switch Lite to anyone while the Joy-Con Drift issue remains unresolved. As a bonus, I included a video of my drift in action. I have a few of these saved on my phone, but this one is my personal favorite, since you can see the in game cursor moving to the right EVEN AS I'M HOLDING THE STICK TO THE LEFT.

"5.0","23-Sep-2019","This is perfect for people who want access to Switch games on a budget...as long as they're willing to go exclusively handheld. Having used both the Switch Lite and the original Switch (in handheld mode), I have to say there are some vast improvements in handheld gaming when it comes to the Lite. Of course, this is to be expected--the device is specialized for a reason. Basically, here were some of my favorite aspects of the Lite: -You still get those lovely, iconic Nintendo sounds. -Access to Nintendo Switch Exclusives -Cheaper than the original -Amazing, smooth touchscreen -High quality picture...absolutely breathtaking. Cons (which you should already know if you've done your research): -No docking/tabletop modes -Have to buy joy cons (and a charging port for said joy cons) separately to play 2-player games or games that are not supported in handheld mode -The battery life could be better...playing Super Mario Odyssey, I got about 3.5 hours out of my brand new Switch Lite. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this gaming system.

"5.0","07-Oct-2019","When the original Switch came out, everyone wanted one. It was the most wanted console in 2017 during the holiday season. Nintendo couldn't meet the demand so sellers would offer them for exorbitant prices, for those who so badly wanted to purchase one. It was a big step up from the Wii U console that couldn't be used as a handheld console. Fast forward to 2019, Nintendo releases the Switch Lite. Is it technically a Switch? Unfortunately, no. For starters, you can no longer place it in a dock and play games on your big screen T.V. I never used the dock/kickstand with my original Switch. Portability was my main reason for purchasing the original Switch. If you like to play games only in handheld mode, then the Lite is for you. Pros: 1. It's lighter and feels more durable. The Switch Lite feels solidly built. 2. $100 cheaper than the OG Switch. 3. Internally the same as the OG Switch. 4. Plays almost all the games the OG Switch can. 5. D-pad 6. Fits in your pocket. Cons: 1. Can no longer play games on your big screen T.V. or table top mode. 2. Decreased battery life. 3. No more detachable joycons. 4. Much smaller screen than the original Switch. All in all, the Switch Lite would be a perfect gift for handheld gamers at an affordable price.

"5.0","22-Sep-2019","Much easier to handle and more robust. Even though the weight  is technically only about 25% lighter—- it feels about 50% so. The screen is smaller but I really didn’t notice a difference yet with gameplay but will update in about a week.  Apart from that it’s the perfect gaming console for on the go or even at home. Much easier to hold for hours at a time. Better internet connection and faster downloads than the original switch somehow though specs are the same.  However : It’s annoying during setup to link your account to an existing user and also maintain data in another console like my original switch. It offers this during setup but then says you can’t until you update software. But to update software you have to complete setup creating a new user anyway. Stupid. And once you do this, then you have to go back into the menu and select save-data  to cloud and sign in etc. Also you should make switch the primary console on your account- so that you don’t have to keep verifying games(using an internet connection) that you purchased on another switch previously- which is automatically set as primary. The lite is always going to be used on the go- so it may not always have an internet connection available to verify you are licensed to play the game.

"5.0","24-Sep-2019","I was ecstatic when the first switch was announced two years ago. I've always loved the feeling of gaming on a handheld device, having grown up with the Gameboy, Gameboy color and Gameboy advance. Years later the PSP and Vita garnered my attention. Console gaming on a TV has its place, as does gaming on a PC. However, there is something that just feels more intimate about a handheld device you can play while sitting on the couch in a relaxed position. Or even more being able to take the experience with you and combat the total boredom of a three hour layover at the airport, followed by another half day in a cramped airplane. I had a switch since it's initial release and while it offered a good experience as a handheld it still lacked something compared to the Gameboy and Playstation devices. Breath of the wild on the go felt like a step in the right direction. But I feel as if the steps were impacted by heavy boots, an awkward and somewhat uncomfortable delivery for the experience. I'm not saying that the switch was a bad design but it was far from ideal given my expectations. Over the past two years my switch never went into the dock to display on my TV, it resigned to a dedicated handheld that eventually lapsed into a distraction only to be used while traveling. The awkward flex of the joycons mixed with the weight and size of the switch let me down a little. But for occasional use I could see past the flaws. Now, onto the switch lite. Immediately after unboxing and holding the device I could tell that this is what I had wanted in the switch two years ago. The weight is well balanced as my hands sit naturally onto the controls and there is no flex when gripping firmly. It's reminiscent of the Vita in all of the best ways. Only this time there's a game library that provides adequate variety. My first impressions could be tainted by the paired release of Link's Awakening, which is wonderful I might add. Finally, I found myself fully engulfed in gaming on the switch. It was like reliving my childhood, spending hours with my Gameboy in my grasp on the very same title. As expected, my hands didn't cramp after a half hour of use like they would with the original switch. The battery held sufficient charge to stay away from the outlet on the other side of my couch for hours on end as well. In my eyes it is perfect in every possibly way as a dedicated handheld gaming console. At last I'm content to finally have a true Vita replacement.","Finally a true Vita replacement","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Lucas L","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews

"3.0","23-Sep-2019","First I want to say that I absolutely love the Switch; so much so that this is the 3rd one I have purchased for my household. As a system and concept I give a full 5 stars easy. However, my new Switch Lite had 2 issues that were enough for me to drop a star each. 1. Brand new out of the box the entire left side of my console stuck and clicked audibly on both the joystick and the D-pad. Amazon quickly sent an exchange unit which did not have this issue but the experience on my first unit, along with the joycon drift on my joycons, gave me a twinge of buyer's remorse. It does not appear that Nintendo implemented their design changes into the new Lite's. I personally feel it is only a matter of time till the same issues present itself and this time I will not have option to just send in my joycon for a replacement. (Deduct 1-star) 2. The second issue is related to Nintendo's OS on the Switch. During the initial system launch my console timed-out during the system transfer and got stuck in a prompt for me to remove my joycons. I performed a hard reset and the same issue happened again. On the third attempt I opted not to perform a system transfer and everything proceeded as normal. While this is not a huge issue, coupled with Nintendo's archaic policies on game sharing across your own consoles were enough for me to deduct another star. In 2019 there is no reason I should not be able to play a digital game I purchased on any console I own without a DRM check between consoles. (Deduct 1-star) Aside from the 2 issues, I love the form factor of the Switch Lite compared to the first version. The weight feels right and there is nothing like having a true D-pad to work with. I find myself using the D-pad in menus way more than the left joystick. The reduction in screen-size has not been noticeable to me (33 year old male) even on games that usually have small font like Fire Emblem.","The Perfect Switch (Minus 2-stars for issues)","Color: Yellow Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","IBuyNReview","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","21-Sep-2019","When I first tried using the original Switch I felt that it was too large in the hands and had a considerable weight to it which took away a lot from the handheld experience. I’m happy to say that the Switch Lite fixes all of these issues thanks to its lighter and smaller overall footprint. It’s a delight to play with and the battery life seems to be about as good as advertised. I’m getting an estimated 3.5-4 hours with Link’s Awakening which is a fairly demanding game. The screen is also extremely bright and looks absolutely beautiful. The colors are also a lot more muted than I had previously thought they would be. The Gray and the Turquoise both look very nice, though I like my gray one the most because of the nice contrast with the buttons. Speaking of the buttons, they feel extremely good. The buttons are more “mushy” than the regular switch but feel very satisfying. The inclusion of the d-pad is also a welcome addition and it feels just amazing. It’s definitely the best d-pad I’ve ever used. The d-pad has the just the right amount of tactile click and mushiness making it a dream to use. If you can forgive the lack of TV output, this is the best handheld gaming console there is and in my opinion the best Switch there is currently.","Portable and Perfect Size","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Aditya Dhar","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","20-Nov-2019","I've used my original Switch probably 80% of the time in handheld mode since I got it, so a smaller version that's handheld-only and with better battery life seemed a no-brainer to me. The original Switch isn't really powerful enough to compete with the other home consoles, but as a handheld it's huuuuuuge, and has really poor battery life. So I was actually excited for a handheld-only version - while I like the idea of a hybrid system and feel it was executed pretty well for a first attempt, I just think a more focused handheld-only Switch should be able to do the thing the system is already best at even better. And generally, the Switch Lite does. It's better built than the original Switch - it doesn't show fingerprints, it doesn't flex or bend, and it just generally feels really solid. It also has a proper Nintendo-style d-pad, which I know is important for some people. The screen is also a tad bit brighter. The weird thing is that it's not that much smaller than the original Switch, and battery life isn't much better either. Both of these things should have been priorities in a handheld-only device. Compared to the 3DS or even 3DS XL, this thing is massive. And as far as battery life goes, I only get about 4 hours. These are both the kinds of things people pointed to for handhelds like the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear failing in the marketplace! The Switch Lite is almost as wide as an Atari Lynx II, and has about the same battery life. The main justification for the size that I've heard is that it has to play games that are meant to be played on a big screen TV, so the screen can't really be that small. But first, the Switch Lite still has some pretty big screen bezels - as big as the PS Vita, a much older handheld. They could have reduced the system's size without further reducing screen size. But second, this is a dedicated handheld. I don't want compromises; I want a handheld. If you want a system with a big screen that can be used to play those big-screen games, get an original Switch! It can be used as either a big-screen system or a handheld; that's why it still exists. For a *dedicated* handheld, I want a small system that I can put in my pocket. I want a system designed as a handheld, not as something slightly smaller than the home version of the system. In other words, there's just not quite enough differentiation between the Switch and Switch Lite in terms of its handheld capabilities, so it's a little hard to recommend this to someone who already has a Switch (like me). It's just not going to be all that much different when carrying it around and using it in handheld mode. That's especially true if you have the ""new"" original Switch (the one that comes in the red box) with its 1-2 hours of extra battery life. In that case, there's really no justification for buying this unless you want to play games simultaneously with your wife or kids. But if you don't have a Switch, and you don't care about hooking up to your TV, then this is definitely the most powerful handheld ever released. It's also cheaper than the original Switch, better built and a bit smaller, so if you're only planning on playing in handheld mode, you may as well get this. But I hope Nintendo keeps iterating (and they usually do) and this is not the last version of the Switch Lite. They really need to get it down to about the size of the 3DS XL, and with 10-12 hours of battery life. Then it'll be a 5 star handheld.","A nice handheld - just too big, and battery life still isn't good enough","Color: Yellow Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Jeff","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews

I was dumbfounded for a second and then I immediately rushed to click the buy now button. I thought I was just seeing things because when I went back to the page again a few seconds later, it showed the overpriced of $280 -300 instead.

"5.0","27-Sep-2019","I travel a lot and this is MUCH BETTER for me than the original switch.  The reasons for this are #1 - Less space.  Overall it is smaller in how much room it takes up in your bags or on your carry on.  It's not a HUGE difference between this and the original, but enough to comment on it. #2 - Joycons are connected.  This may not be a positive for everyone but it is for me.  My old switch kept on occasionally having the Joycon come off of it while it was in the case while traveling through the airport or other locations.  This was annoying because you'd have to snap it back, or if it was really minor and you didn't notice it, you'd get a notice and then realize you had to snap it back.  You never have to worry about this with the lite.  Those who preferred removable Joycons will probably dislike this as it makes it so that you cannot really play a multiplayer game with what comes in the box, but for me it is a bonus. 3 - Longer battery life.  The lite, simply put, last longer on one charge than my original Switch did.  I REALLY enjoy this feature the most out of all the differences of the Lite and the original switch. 4 - It may be just me, but it feels more solid and durable than my original.  It doesn't feel like it will break in half (Though the original has not broken in half or cracked on me yet either, it just feels more fragile like it will).  The smaller size may have something to do with this. 5 - It has a D-pad instead of buttons.  I enjoy the D-pad.  ON the downside, with the controls ,as the lite is smaller, for those with larger hands it can feel more cramped. Overall, I really like the smaller size for travel, and the longer battery life (also with travel, as this is a great perk).","For Those who travel this is better than the original","Color: Turquoise Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Grey Lone Wolf","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","18-Oct-2019","Update (Feb. 12, 2020): I originally gave this product 5 stars because the excitement of a brand-new handheld Nintendo console had not yet worn off. Now that I've been using it for a few months, there are a few things I take issue with. The first issue I've noticed is that the eShop is PAINFULLY slow compared to other devices. I understand that the Switch is behind other consoles in general, but I think there's an issue when it can run Minecraft (a CPU-intensive game) better than it can run the eShop. I know that in my original review I said that the eShop lag wasn't too bad, but it can be at times. I really don't see the reason for this. I mean, it's not a smooth experience at all. The icons take a while to load sometimes and if I scroll too fast I have to wait for it to catch up. It's the same thing when I switch between the menus, too. And no, it's not my WiFi. Now, the other issue I have is the home screen. On the 3DS, you could customize the icons however you wanted, you could put things in folders, and you could even have really cool themes! With the Switch, you don't get any of this. You get a dark mode and a light mode. That's it. Now, if you don't care about these features that's fine, but I personally like having the option to personalize my devices. Also, it's painful having to scroll through the games you have installed on your switch because the icons are so large and you can't make them stay where you want them. It's just really clunky and annoying. Another thing is if you're looking to you're looking to use your Switch for anything other than playing games, you're out of luck. There is no internet browser and no streaming apps. There is a YouTube app, but it's kind of bare-bones and you can't look at comments on videos. So, for these reasons I had to knock off a star from my review. The only reason I didn't remove more stars is because I still believe the Switch is a great system with a lot of potential. I still believe that Nintendo should continue with this idea and I hope that they take people's criticism into consideration. Oh, and this isn't really the SL's fault, but the screen is pretty small so certain games can be hard to play on it because it can be hard to see certain parts of the UI. Just something to look out for. Also, I know some people have already been experiencing JoyCon drift with this console, but I personally haven't had a problem with it yet. Original Review (Oct. 2019) I really, REALLY love this system. I don't own the original Nintendo Switch, and I got the Lite because of the lower price point and the lovely colors. I also wanted to play a lot of the games that are on the Switch, but not the 3DS. I was going to wait for the Zacian and Zamazenta edition to come out, but I decided I liked the turquoise edition better and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Now that I have it, I must say that I am very pleased with its performance. It runs faster than I expected from a system that is so small. I haven't noticed any severe lag (although it does lag a little bit if I go through the eShop categories too fast). Speaking of size, the Switch Lite is perfect. It's just big enough that I can see the screen just fine, but not too big that it's uncomfortable to hold. Keep in mind that I am someone with fairly small hands, so a person with larger hands may find the buttons and joysticks to be too close/cramped for their liking. The screen resolution is one of the highlights of this system. Compared to my 3DS XL, the screen is fantastic. Seriously, I didn't realize how bad the 3DS screen is until I compared it with this system. All the games look amazing, especially Super Mario Bros. U. Mario Kart 8 also looks great. Another thing I like a lot is the form factor. I like that everything I need to see is just on one screen and that the buttons right there beside it. It's not that I don't like the clam-shell design of the DS line, it's just that this form factor feels more comfortable to me. Of course, the form factor does come with its downsides. For example, it's going to be a lot easier to scratch the screen and the buttons. But that can be remedied if you just get a screen protector and a case to put it in. Another thing I like is that it comes with a charger. It seems like a no-brainer to put something to charge the device in with the packaging of the device itself, but guess what? When I got my 3DS, I had to buy the charger separately. Just another way for Nintendo to get money out of me, I guess. Luckily they did not make the same mistake with the Switch Lite. I also like that the cable on the charger is so long. It makes it easier for me to charge it and play it at the same time because I can get comfortable without worrying about holding my Switch in an awkward position. Although there are a ton of positives about the Switch Lite, I do have one complaint. My screen came with a stuck pixel. That really annoys me, but because it's kind of a light green/white I can't really see it when I'm playing games unless I'm specifically looking for it on the screen. I can only really see it when I'm in the eShop. It does suck though that an otherwise perfect system would have a flaw that can really be annoying at times. And anyway, Nintendo has said that it's a common issue with the screens so I don't expect that they would do much about it anyway. I was pretty disappointed when I figured out that the DS line of systems is pretty much dead now, but after buying the Switch Lite I'm kind of excited for the future of Nintendo handheld systems. I hope that they come out with more colors for the Lite and I also hope they expand upon this system like they did with the DS line. Overall, I think this system is a drastic improvement upon the DS line, but beware of stuck pixels and the fact that Nintendo does not seem to care about them.","The Future of Nintendo Handhelds?","Color: Turquoise Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Alex","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

"2.0","18-Oct-2019","For starters I'm not a big fan of motion sensors, rumble, and paying over $250 for a gaming system which is why I bought this Switch. Now for the flaws I found in this thing. First flaw is this has no efficient instruction manual how to properly setup the thing where it took me hours of watching lot of YouTube just to linked my main Nintendo Network account without accidentally making a new account in the process which makes sign-in into my PS4 that is easy as opening a door. Second flaw that is the biggest one to remember is the charging setup where I know you need a power cord that requires certain power setups or it'll ruin any Switch which I can get over but the main problem is when you do plug it up to the charger it'll turn on so don't expect it to off when charging it as well there is no charging lights showing if it's still charging or done charging where on the older consoles once the light is off it's done charging which is better then turning it on then check if it's done charging then turn it off. There is about two or more flaws which aren't major like the ones I posted which is annoying but not a big problem and I'm trying to like it but Nintendo failed to understand consumer benefits compared to their own benefits which is why I'm giving it a 2 star rating.","More flaws then perfection. 😒","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Mr. Game&Grump","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

"1.0","07-Dec-2019","I absolutely love love loved my Switch Lite from the moment I got it, but unfortunately it died within two weeks. Actually, the unit “bricked,” meaning it got stuck on the logo screen whenever it started up. There’s lots of info on this on various online forums, and some posts I saw go back two years. So this is a known issue that has yet to be resolved. I’m not using any third-party accessories, which I read can cause this problem. This was especially unfortunate for me because I hadn’t signed up for a Nintendo Switch Online account yet, so in all likelihood I’ve lost my game data. On the plus side, Nintendo support is top notch. I was able to speak to a support person right away, and I was given clear instructions on how to send back the unit and track the repair/replacement status. Still, I would caution others when considering a Switch. Very disappointing, Nintendo. :-(","Died (or “bricked”) after two weeks","Color: Yellow Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Steven Joya","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","09-Jan-2020","I love having the switch lite! It feels so much more comfortable in your hands than the normal N-Switch and I've been playing much more lite switch games on the go because I'm a person, who's not home much and I love many of my switch games but I don't have much time to play them at home but with the switch lite, I can easily take it on the road with me and try to actually play them through for all the games I have for the system, for many months now and actually try to complete them and not let them go to waste. The lite is a great buy for anyone who really wants to play switch games on the go and it is also, at a better price point for those who aren't willing to shell out the extra $100-$150 more for the standard system but still want to be able to enjoy all of the great games that it does offer. It's definitely worth it, at least to me it is, I highly recommend it for people who travel on buses or trains to have something to entertain them on their way to work or anywhere else!","Using it more than my regular switch!","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qq4PYCNEL._SY88.jpg","Verified Purchase","Danny","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","25-Dec-2019","The Switch Lite is slightly smaller than the regular and fits perfectly in my hands (I have smaller hands)! I am also enjoying the vibrance of the colors available. I haven't seen this posted much, but the screen is a touch screen just like the regular switch. This is probably obvious to many, but since I had never had a switch befor this, I didn't know about the touchscreen and figured there might be a couple of people out there in the same boat. The screen is also amazingly clear and doesn't at all seem to be lacking in quality compared to its full-priced version (other than being a bit smaller). I am really happy with this purchase and have been having quite a bit of fun playing the new Nintendo games like Pokemon Sword, Luigi's Mansion, Link's Awakening, etc. I purchased the Switch Lite over the regular Switch because of my love of handheld gaming -- I knew I wasn't going to use the TV hookup at all if I bought the regular. For anyone who feels similar, I would highly recommend the Switch Lite.","Love it!","Color: Yellow Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Amy","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

"3.0","24-Sep-2019","I'm a guy in my mid 30's, I live in Southern California, and I'm a huge Nintendo fan. I just got the Nintendo Switch Lite and have been playing it for the last few days. This system has a LOT going for it, but it falls short of being great. First, let's start with the PROS: 1. It's a smaller, more portable switch 2. It has a regular/traditional Dpad, better for 2d games 3. It's semi-pocketable, making it easier to take with you on the go 4. It's pretty lightweight 5. It has a crisp, high resolution screen 6. There's some pretty decent games on the Switch: Mario Maker 2, Mario Odyseey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Zelda, and now SNES games online 7. This is the first true Nintendo portable system in about 15 years that goes back to having a SINGLE screen. I like that because I thought the second screen on the DS/3DS/2DS line were just gimmicks that you didn't really need 8. It's a portable that has console quality graphics on the go 9. It's the first true portable from Nintendo that has an ANALOG STICK! Before, it was only a slider, now its a true stick. 10. It's a sleek, modern looking unit. Okay, now the CONS... 1. It's not that cheap. $199 doesn't include the cost of the game, sales tax, shipping, a case, etc. 2. This is the first ""portable"" system in which the games are the cost of a home console. $60/each. 3. There's no rumble feature 4. There's no TV out 5. It's a switch with no ""switching"" feature 6. The Analog stick is not nearly as good as the analog joystick on the N64. The N64 had a wider degree of freedom/precision. 7. The DPad is TINY! I mean, REALLY tiny, so much so that its difficult to use 8. The DPad is MISALIGNED (not horizontally aligned) with the action buttons 9. There's no STYLUS! It's only compatible with those so-called ""styluses"" that have dull, rubber nibs. 10. On the right side of the unit, the right analog stick pokes up at your thumb when pressing the ""B"" button 11. It's nothing TRULY innovative. It's a smaller switch. That's it. Would have been nice if Nintendo made something really ahead of its time, like a flexible display (see Samsung Galaxy Fold) 12. No N64 games! Where's the N64 virtual console? This system would be great for that. 13. It's still NOT comfortable in the pocket. Would have been better if it could fold up, so it was easier to take with you everywhere 14. It's not that ""lite."" The unit has a considerable weight to it So, I have mixed feelings about the switch lite. It's a step forward in the right direction, but I felt Nintendo could have been more careful in its design, and more daring in its innovation/delivery.","An Amazing handheld with some Serious FLAWS","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Mate3355","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

I bought Daemon X Machina and Zelda Breath of the Wild for my switch lite and been having a lot of fun playing these games which I highly recommend.

"4.0","11-Nov-2019","So I have owned a PlayStation vita for years and I love that console. It's basically unavoidable that I'm going to end up comparing the two. I bought the Nintendo console to get access to new games. Though I was interested in getting the original switch, I waited because I read about a number of problems, and I know Nintendo have a habit of bringing out a follow up console soon after. I like this. It fits well in my hands. My hands are quite big, and all of the buttons are very accessible. This is an advantage for me over the vita because it sometimes felt like your hands would cramp. Two things hit me right away about the Nintendo. Where's the Netflix app? Where's the internet browser? It still looks like a tablet, much like the original, yet smaller. So I don't see why it can't have these two things. The vita does and its ancient now. Seems like it should be added. The most important part is the games. I went browsing through the library and there were thousands of games on there. I downloaded a few games and they came across and ready to play quickly. I can tell you the vita took forever with larger downloads. Not so with the Nintendo. I was playing within minutes. Another feature I love is the memory. Huge advantage over the vita. Sony were basically ripping off the gamers with the absurd prices of memory cards. This system comes with 32gb. And takes any sd card. This is learning from Sony's horrible mistakes in the best way. Im so happy with this. What I'm not terribly fond of are the game prices. I will keep my vita and plan to still play it. Some of the games Nintendo have on their library, Sony also has. There isn't a huge difference in quality but Nintendo has noticeably higher prices. Thsts a bit of a shame but I can live with it. Fantastic mix of old and new games, cheap memory, and a nice console with a good size. Do I love it more than my vita? Don't know yet. But I will update this later with a final verdict *** updating*** Having used this a bit now, I find that the battery drains a bit quicker than the vita does. The vita would hover around full charge for a long time, then suddenly drop to a low charge and stay there for a long time. The Nintendo battery doesn't last quite as long but the meter drops gradually. It's not a problem for me on either console. I do find that I love the games on the Nintendo. Been playing guns gore and cannoli. It's along the same lines as rocketbirds but with an altogether different story line. But I feel the Nintendo definitely has the edge with graphics. Also downloaded doom, which is just as much fun as I remember from the 1990s. On the vita you would need to hack the thing to play that game. As far as which one is working out better I still can't make up my mind. Update*** It seems I am more or less ignoring the vita now. Sad to admit that as I do love it so much. Fact is though the games I am playing on the Nintendo are just better. And those are newer games too. I feel like the vita has some Important advantages over the nintendo despite arriving much earlier. You know, battery life, screen quality and an internet browser. However it's the games that matter. The vita has great games but it won't have new games. Recommending my friend pedro for adult gamers, and I'm quite liking Ghostbusters and capcoms fight bundle. ***update*** One criticism I have of this is that for anyone with big hands you are going to feel your hands cramping and, for me at least, it doesn't even take long. I suspect it is due to the position of the buttons, sticks and shoulder buttons. I don't usually play for more than 20 minutes at a time and I feel the cramp in my hands. If you don't have big hands it might not be an issue. Though I won't reduce the rating for the console because of this. There are grips you can buy for both the switch and switch lite to help with this problem. Going to try one of those now to see if it helps.","Happy","Color: Yellow Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","mr dead","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews

After a few months with this device my conclusions are this: Animal crossing was fun. There are plenty of games for this machine, but it is underpowered compared to a regular switch. Demos I have downloaded such as resident evil have had frame rates that look to be 15 or 20, stuttery and just bad. The Nintendo Online service, which I needed to play the game with my girlfriend and browse their online store, costs you a monthly fee and seems to have literally no curation or thought put into it, while also having the most expensive prices I have seen and the worst sales. Id love to try out more titles but next to nothing good ever goes on sale, and from what I have researched this is normal Nintendo. The Zelda game is supposed to be good, but it is still $60 and never goes on sale yet it’s almost 4 years old.  Come on.

I played Animal Crossing and several other games for weeks to months without being connected to the internet (digital downloads and hard copies). Whoever wrote that must be talking about specific content in a specific game that requires internet (many games have features that require internet, that's not new).

It's really nice to have a handheld version of the console with very little sacrifices. The only minor complaint I have with the Switch Lite is that the battery life is somewhat lacking. I know the graphics are really good for a handheld, but I wish the battery lasted for several or more hours longer than it does. I mean, you still get around 3-4 hours on average per charge, but would have liked it if the battery lasted for like around 6-8 hours. Oh well, you sacrifice battery life for really good graphics, so it can't be helped. Other than that, I have no complains about the Switch Lite. It is very easy to hold in your hands and doesn't feel awkward. The buttons, directional pad, and analog stick placements are really good. The speakers are not the best, but gets loud enough and sounds good. I did notice the back gets sort of hot while charging and playing games at the same time, but not too hot. This is a nice handheld game system to add to your collection, especially if you like JRPGs (Japanese-style role playing games).

"5.0","15-Jul-2020","It arrived safe and sound from the seller. I absolutely love it! I've been wanting to buy a Switch for a long time but debated on which one, the regular or LITE. I ended up opting for the Lite version.  The screen is slightly smaller than a regular switch but it's not that big of a deal as I've played on other smaller screens before such as the 3DS and PSP-- which are tinier in comparison and also had smaller analog sticks and buttons. Additionally, I decided to get my hands on separate joycons and a phone stand for the switch Lite which allows me to sit back on a chair and enjoy at a distance when I dont want to hold it. Overall, I'm glad to have made the purchase. Now I can finally play LOZ: BOTW at my own comfort and glee. Please note that if you plan to share the LITE in a family, it wouldn't be ideal as there is no docking option. This is ideal for  individuals who loves to travel around their own home or around other places.

"3.0","17-Oct-2020","The Nintendo Switch Lite offers handheld only play. Which is fine. The color of the Lite is cosmetic only with many different case and skin options. I was able to play a game on the Lite as I play on my console and the first thing I noticed was graphic issues. Distant artifacts (moving objects, other players, static objects) tend to be more pixelated. The farther away they were the more pixelated they were. Some I couldn’t even recognize, even though I’m extremely familiar with the game. A simple 15 minute game play reduced the battery from 100% to 83% with the game mentioned earlier. Battery life varies from game to game. The device got warm while playing but was noticeably warmer while charging, in sleep mode. Thankfully there is a setting to power the device completely off to save battery instead of keeping it in sleep mode. The device felt sluggish trying to play said game. Not sure if the game was taxing the system as there is a lot going on and needs to be connected to WiFi. Has many Nintendo classic games for sale of course, or you can buy new games for $60. Which the price of them doesn’t fall for almost a year. The screen is a touchscreen. Overall I would give the Nintendo Switch Lite a generous 4/5 stars. But I’m reality it’s a 3/5 star device due to no backward compatibility with prior system games, high cost of games long after they’ve came out, very limited free games section, weak battery life and as I said before a weak graphics chip. The Lite should have cost $150, with the regular switch costing $250. If you see the Lite being sold for more than $199 then your being scammed. Buy from someone else or someplace else. The regular Switch is being sold for $299. Again higher prices means your being scammed.

Being that the Switch Lite is a handheld device and an fairly economical and portable, its a bit smaller and lighter to transport around yet the outdated mode of having to plug in your headphones is one star off the rating as you would have to purchase a external third party plug in device via the USB-C port to allow for Bluetooth capabilities. Asides for not being able to play some of the better games that are available on the main Switch Console, what’s available for the Switch Lite isn’t bad yet their will be more added to its online ecosystem down the road.","A good to honest review of a handheld gaming console that’s pretty good yet not excellent.","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Chuck AzEee!","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","07-May-2020","My partner was very interested in getting a Nintendo switch after he saw me playing animal Crossing for quite some time. He wanted something a little bit more portable and didn’t need all the bells and whistle’s, so we decided to go with the switch light. It was simple and easy to set up, as the only thing that comes with in the box is the consul itself and the charging brick. We did opt to buy a larger micro SD card at some of the games he wanted to play with some of the largest on the Nintendo shop like Zelda breath of the wild and Skyrim. So far we have had no issues and he is loving playing his switch light every morning and evening, mostly on animal crossing for now. The battery life does seem to be decent as it actually outlasts my original Nintendo switch I got on launch day. The sound and audio is crisp and clear we have had no issues to report so far. I do recommend getting yourself a travel case and a glass screen protector from the get go however. I will say this. Do not fall for all the scams of people trying to sell the switch light for more than $199 retail value. Nintendo has been ramping up the production of the console and it is starting to be restocked everywhere slowly but surely. Don’t let these money hungry bandits take your hard earned money and charge you extra for a system just because of pandemic is keeping us in doors. Amazon is doing a good job of keeping it in stock here and there. Just be patient and it will be back.","Perfect Portable Gaming Courtesy of Nintendo","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","InkBearGA","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","13-Feb-2020","Very fun games. I bought the light to save some money and ny nephew has the original already. My only single 1 complaint is the battery. No one ever warned me about how bad the battery is. And this is supposed to last longer than the original battery? It's fine for a bus trip but definitely not a road trip out of town it lasts maybe 4ish hours. It's not horrible but I remember how the DS, DS lite, 3DS lasted me so long and I could leave it on sleep for months and they would be close to full It feels great in my hands. Ashamed to say I have smallish hands for a man. about medium+ glove size. Buttons feel a lot better than the joy cons do. Small enough to fit in male pant pockets unless you wear skinny jeans maybe, I wear lose pants. The speakers a fairly loud or loud enough for me at half volume in a noisy house. Update year later. It turns out my hands aren't as small as I thought. My sister just has huge man hands like kawhi Leonard so I thought I had small hands. I'm a large size - XLarge size glove.","Only 1 complaint.","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","David L.","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","02-Dec-2019","This system worked perfect out of box for me.  I upgraded my single Nintendo membership to a family membership, because until recently me and my daughter shared one Switch, and added my daughter.  I made her Switch my primary Switch, and the Switch lite my nonprimary Switch.  Now we are both able to play every game I have purchased through the market without issue. The only difference I see is this unit is slightly smaller than the regular Switch but not enough to even phase me.  I have smaller hands so it actually fits me better than the full sized Switch.  Also it can not be docked and used on the television which isn't so much an issue for me either.  Also the remotes on side don't come off but I didn't much prefer to do that so it doesn't bother me.  Also you do have to have Wi-Fi access to play games downloaded off the market place.

"5.0","13-Jun-2020","The Switch Lite is a little smaller that the original switch, and due to that it is more comfortable to hold and play.  Since we got it a few months ago, it's been getting 2 to 4 hours of play a day (thank you Animal Crossing) and the battery only needs to be charged every 2nd or 3rd day. This is our 2nd Switch and we've 4 users on the 2 Switches.  We were disappointed to find that only one user can play a game that's downloaded onto a secondary Switch.  We initially downloaded Animal Crossing on the Switch Lite but only I could play the game and neither of my kids could.  So we ended up transferring the license to our ""main"" Switch, there all of us could play the downloaded version, and then put the physical game card in the Switch Lite (our secondary) and we all could play on that. So long story short, if this is your second or more Switch, buy the physical games rather than download them. Otherwise the Switch LIte runs just like a switch, only you can't display the output to a TV, it's only viewable on the unit itself.","Great new version of the Switch","Color: Coral Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Thomas A.

"5.0","19-Sep-2020","I was never a huge video game player. Mainly because I could only go a few hours stairing at a big TV or having my laptop on my lap. I could never really get comfortable. Not to mention the money it costs to have a laptop that is powerful enough to play the most popular games. Having to download games is also a hassle because my internet is limited. So an option where I can just buy the physical versions of games and pop them in? It sounds 'stone age' to most, but is what has been amazing for me. I now have something to do when I am feeling isolated and lonely. The absolute boredom and emotional pain that has been the last eight months of my life. I've found something that makes things easier to cope with. Keeps me connected to several of my friends, gives me and them something to do, something to do together. The lite is perfect for me because I am the only person in my household interested in playing games and it's perfect for my small hands.

I can't say it ruins any games though. While the Switch is also mobile, this thing takes it to a new level by being much more convenient to bring around as a true handheld console. The Switch is heavy and not comfortable to use while laying in bed or on the couch. This thing feels just like using a 3DS.

This was purchased for my partner as we both had started using our original full size Switch more and needed an additional console. The Lite gets right as a handheld system all the things the full size switch got wrong. It's much more light weight and far more comfortable to hold. It just feels right. Our original switch stays in docked mode 99% of the time. The screen size is perfect, I was nervous it would be too small but it's exactly where it needs to be. My only real issue with the screen is there's no way to tweak the settings other than brightness, but that's just nitpicking. The blue is a lovely color.

I have been hanging on to my Day One Sony PSVita handheld as long as possible. Now that Sony has officially killed the Vita, I decided to give the Switch a try. I haven't been a fan of Nintendo since the Gameboy days so it's fitting. The console is fast, light, comfortable, and colorful. My complaint is with the box I received. When I buy items from Amazon, shipped by Amazon I expect a new product that looks nice. If this was a gift I would have had to return it. The outer shipping box was in perfect condition so this was boxed up at the warehouse looking like it was stepped on , and not from the delivery driver. The driver was actually really cool. The box was crushed, had holes poked through from being pushed on so hard, there was no seals on the box, the upper portion of the screen has little marks across it too which I will ad a picture later on in an edit. I was definitely not the first person to open the box. Luckily it worked.

Screen: For those nerds out there you will notice the higher pixel density, especially in games with more detail. Generally the screen is big enough for Fortnite, Pokemon Shield, and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I haven't played a game that felt unplayable yet. Controlls: Arguably it controls better than the original Switch, less clicky buttons and Nintendo's signature d-pad. Gyro controlls are still present, so aiming in Splatoon 2 and Zelda is the same as before. Feel: It feels far better than the original Switch for long play sessions, and it feels better in the hands. Battery life: Battery life is good, after a full charge I could play Minecraft at max simulation distance for 5 hours. But if you're going on the road yoh will need a battery bank. Notes: This is a handheld console only, you WILL NEVER be able to dock on a TV. There is also no rumble at all, although that'd be nice to have, you won't notice its abscence in-game. Lastly there is no IR sensor, and if you just asked yourself ""what's and IR sensor"" yoy won't care about it being gone. But because of the exclusion IR sensors Nintendo Labo and One Two Switch are unplayable. Advice: Don't buy One Two Switch, it will never be worth $60. Get a slim travel case, and a screen protector. If you are giving this to a child put AS MUCH PROTECTIVE CASING AS POSSIBLE.","The Best Nintendo Handheld?","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","David","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","23-Oct-2019","This is a great version of the Nintendo Switch! It's definitely aimed at people like myself who only have an interest in playing the Switch portably and wish to not have the bulk that comes with the OG (Model 1 or Model 2) Switch. Sure, we Switch Lite users can't play certain games (like Super Mario Party or 1-2-Switch), but it's still only a handful of games. I've been able to play Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros, Poken Tournament, Tetris 99, and Rayman: Legends Definitive Edition all pretty flawlessly. I'd recommend this mainly to people who were on the fence about the Switch like I was. It's still not a bad idea as a companion piece to your OG Switch, however.

Just with the regular one, you do not need to replace the entire unit and you can just either get a new Joy-Con or fix it (very easy and cheap to do). Spoke with Nintendo Support, they need to get the Switch Lite for at least 3 weeks and no way to extend the warranty to cover these ""guaranteed to fail"" Joy-Con sooner or later. Besides that, with the $100 more you spend on the regular Switch, you get: 1) Docking Station to TV (Lite cannot do that) 2) Vibrating Joy-Con (Lite does not support this) 3) Ability to play some games the Lite cannot (including Legend of Zelda) as you need to have the controllers moving independently which the lite does not support.

I bought it used-very good and honestly it almost seems brand new. I was super worried it would come damaged or with scratches or that it would get lost. But nope! Got delivered to my doorstep not a scratch, and even needed a signature too which made me feel so much better!! Anywho about the actual switch. I was also worried that the screen would be too small and I wouldn’t enjoy playing breath of the wild or Skyrim on it (soon the new animal crossing game as well) but while playing, it seems as tho I’m playing handheld on the regular switch (playing docked and on a tv gives me a headache anyway so I prefer this) the only thing I worry about now is the drift issue which happens on the switch where the control sticks start to drift. Luckily I know how to fix that myself (you can watch YouTube videos on how to do it) but unfortunately, instead of just taking apart the joy cons I’m gonna have to take the whole thing apart and get under the motherboard 😅😅😅 so. That hasn’t happened yet but I definitely encourage  Nintendo to do something about that since the lite can’t replace joycons for those who don’t know how to fix them.","Cute little guy with big attitude","Color: Turquoise Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Katie","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

"3.0","07-Aug-2020","Nintendo really seems to be cheaping out on their consoles now. Not even two months into my ownership of my brand new Switch Lite, and the left joy stick is already going out (the calibration test confirmed my suspicions). Normally, you could just chalk this up to bad luck, a one in a million chance... at least, you would if this wasn't the second consecutive time you've received a lemon console. This same exact issue plagued my new 2DS XL when I bought it 3 years ago, and after that nightmare of a repair I can't believe this happened again. Sent that in for repair and it came back with a loose dust cover flap, along with greasy fingerprints all over both screens! As someone who takes great care of their consoles, I was horrified. With this knowledge comes extreme disappointment that Amazon won't replace my system, as I am very reluctant to send it in to Nintendo's chop shop. The possibility that I could just be sent a refurbished console kills me even more. I bought a NEW console for a reason, why would I want to receive in return something that is anything less? Aside from my obviously bum joy stick, the functionality and appearance of my Switch is otherwise pristine. I mean, I wipe this thing down with my microfiber cloth every time after I turn it off, then promptly put it back in it's case. Considering also all the features I lost, plus a worse battery than the new model Switch, I genuinely feel like I got screwed. Getting $100 off ain't lookin' so good all of a sudden. I would give a lower rating, but the quality of the games I have counter balance it a little. Nintendo loses yet another point in my book.","They don't make 'em like they used to","Color: Yellow Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Matthew","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews

"5.0","30-May-2020","The photos don’t do it justice.  I grew up with Gameboy and super Mario games. I’m also PlayStation fan boy by heart and last time I had Nintendo was the original Wii which I still have. I decided to buy the Gray - Switch Lite since they announced Paper Mario (and rumored Super Mario Galaxy). Nintendo made a smart move by following the trend of remakes because I played these games from night until dawn in elementary school; I am 24 now. I’m so happy I bought the switch lite for its great value. This console is truly pushing the limits to current technology to its maximum. The screen is crystal clear while never compromising the vivid colors and games’ unique styles exclusively on switch & cross platform games. During PS4, I became a huge indie game lover. The second my switch lite came, binge bought a bunch of great games under 9$ with real deals on gems of up to 90% off. My first switch game to buy and play is Planet Alpha (originally 20$ bought for 3.50$) and it’s perfect indie game that truly makes you understand the design of switch lite with comfort and ease; and again never comprising beauty exclusive switch game. The sense of ease and the light portability of the console that does not compromise the beauty of games full immerses you into a personal gaming experience that’s fun at any given moment. I also bought Overwatch on switch, which is also my go to on PS, to try and test my comfort level since I haven’t really played a handheld device in years. Overwatch is a great game to test the comfort on the switch lite because the game utilizes every button on the controller and in a fast paced. After a while it does feel a bit cramped but after adjusting the sensitivity you grow accustomed. OW surprised me so much and it is mind boggling to how they were able to compress the game onto this amazing console. Overall, I am satisfied and excited to spend years exploring the vast and diverse Nintendo library. This console is extremely worth it so far. No doubt Nintendo hit the nail on this console.","An immersive gaming experience","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R0v3xxmKL._SY88.jpg

"5.0","04-Jun-2020","Of course this had to be 5 stars, it's Nintendo! This smaller, more lightweight version of the Switch definitely earns the title of ""Lite"", but dont let that fool you. Its every bit the power and capabilities of the big guy- just in a smaller, more portable, easier to carry and take with you body. I'd recommend the Switch Lite to casual gamers, those that dont really spend that much time on videogames and their vibe is more tailored to one-player games they catch up with every now and then while theyre in the subway on their way to work or at the kitchen waiting for dinner to finish cooking. The controllers dont detach like the original Switch does, but then again, if youre that much of a casual player, you dont need them too. You can still do multiplayer as long as its online, and in extreme scenarios it does recognize wireless controllers, so you can set it up as a mini screen instead, but that would be something more hardcore gamers would do, and for that, theres the oroginal Switch. This one is more private, more you-exclusive, your own little world just for you and no one else. That's the Switch Lite! And the colors? The original Switch wishes it could do that! Theres three fun colors to choose from (and black, well, more of like a really dark gray). I went with the yellow and havent regretted it since. People who see it love the color too. I hear its the color that most runs out of shelves because people love it so much, but I digress. The Switch Lite is a little beast! And every game for the Switch is just as playable and downloadable in it as it is for the original, and to top it off, its a full one hundred dollars less than the big guy! Itd say for a more personalized, maybe even casual gaming experience, you just cant beat the Nintendo Switch Lite.

The lite is great but it is not worth the hassle of having two switches especially if you switch between them regularly as the unit that is not the primary will constantly require an internet connection to see if the game is playable.  I think Nintendo could find a better way to do this as it is really inconvenient if I have to find an internet connection just to play my games.  With the full size switch the connector at the bottom makes sense for docking even if it is annoying but Nintendo should have used the opportunity to put it in a better location.

"5.0","25-Dec-2019","The only cons of this console(which im going to call ""lite"") is that it doesnt support some games and the joycons that dont detach. Besides that the lite feels much more durable than the switch, similar to the feeling of the original bulky DS. If you already have a switch and looking for a second for a bf/gf, kids, etc, this is the perfect solution at $100 off. You never have to worry about the battery life of the joycons(because there are none.) Now if you dont have the original switch, I would recommend evaluating what youre going to buy the consoles for. If youre looking to buy party games, go with the original.

"5.0","18-May-2020","First: GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR PLEASE!!! If you're like me, you're on a tighter budget, so you grabbed this because it's cheaper and smaller. But get a normal switch. Trust me. I love the handheld experience but it becomes a bit much on the eyes so switching to a TV would've been a convenient way to ease that. Playing with friends? Eh... Other than that 5 stars because it does what it says flawlessly. The games are fun, the handheld experience is great, it's not as heavy as a normal switch. Oh and get a screen protector because these things are insanely too easy to scratch up. I made that mistake and I'm paying for it. Figuratively and literally. To sum this all up, if you're looking for a cheap alternative to the switch and you don't mind losing the ability to dock it to a TV and replace joycons, and like the handheld experience, get this by all means. If you want to be able to play with a sibling or friends, save up that extra $100 because it's so much more worth it.","I loved this, but get the normal switch.","Color: Gray Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Michael Dorso","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews

"4.0","25-Sep-2020","Had it for almost a week and enjoying it. A few hiccups here and there but nothing major. Bought some accessories for it too. Just wish software can continue to download without stopping in the process while in screen lock. Also, wish it had built in bluetooth. It’s 2020 and I was quite shocked to learn that none of the switches (regular and lite) have built in bluetooth, so I will have to buy a bluetooth adapter for it. I am not a fan of the built in speakers. Some games allow the full range of volume, while some make the system sound very low which is the reason I want bluetooth to use my JBL speaker for a better experience. It’s a handheld, which I understand, so I am not too bothered by it. Overall, I still prefer over the regular because I wanted a handheld for personal experience rather than share with others.

"5.0","14-Oct-2019","The Nintendo Switch lite is the new member to the switch family. As the name says it, the switch lite is a “lite” version of the original switch. Witch mean it isn’t “dockable” and the joy cons can’t be removed. It’s a one piece unit and it plays all if not, most switch games. It’s light weight and rests comfortably on your hands, the console is made out of plastic and therefore it has a “plastic-y“ feel but it doesn’t feel like cheap plastic. In my eyes it is a perfect console for those who are looking for a portable console with a massive library of games that range from first to third party games with many genres. My only complaint has to be the battery life. It would have been a perfect console if the battery life lasted 8-10 hours. The Nintendo Switch lite gets a rating of 9.5/10","Almost Perfect.

"4.0","02-Jun-2020","bought this a month ago when it was sold by the nintendo company, $199 plus shipping and tax with ended with $123. Came packaged securely and with a charger and the switch in a plastic bag. The battery lasts about four hours for me but three hours when it’s 15%. Bought games for it and the game play is really good graphics and nice feel to it. The joycons have a grip to it and nice the buttons are soft also. Played animal crossing with my friends who also have switch lites and easy connection to the internet. But if you want to play online with local or friends you have to have internet connection! With wifi, it connects just fine and smoothly but with hotspot to a phone or device, it disconnects easily and really angers me. I’ve played many games on it Mario odyssey, Luigis mansion 3, Animal crossing new horizons, and many more and all are good quality. I sometimes give to my little brother and he dropped it a couple times but the screen didn’t crack (Since it’s plastic) and the side buttons click fine. I don’t think it necessary to get a case and screen protector for the switch but your choice is fine. If you already have a the original or newer version of the switch I recommend you shouldn’t get this switch bc it has less features. if you don’t have a switch, this is a really good alternative to the original switch and cheaper regarding the sellers that buy the switches and sell for more.

"5.0","03-Jan-2020","I bought this for my boyfriend who is normally a PC gamer (and who chose the 5-star rating for this review), but he wanted to play a few certain switch games. He really loves it and to my surprise wishes he had some of his PC games on the Switch Lite instead. He likes the d-pad on the right which the normal switch doesn’t have since the joycons all need to be the same. The one con to this compared to the normal switch is that if it’s low on battery and he wants to play, he needs to sit by the wall to charge it. No docking option. Games with a lot of text are especially nice for him on this because he has a hard time reading the text on the TV, but not when playing handheld. Of course you could achieve this with a regular switch, but at a higher price point. So in conclusion, if you have a hard time with reading on the TV and would like to play handheld all of the time, this is a great alternative to the normal switch. On the other hand, if you like playing on the TV or if your eyes have a hard time looking at small, close up screens for long periods of time like mine, the normal switch is worth the cost.","Awesome device for those who like playing handheld","Color: Turquoise Style: Lite Console","","Verified Purchase","Carrie Rider","Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise","https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise/product-reviews/B07V4GCFP9/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews

Mario, Link, and the rest of them aren’t coming to pc anytime soon.

The switch lites buttons are wobbly(reminds me of 3ds), the sticks are not as sturdy, the screen is almost soft plastic (must buy screensaver).

"1.0","10-May-2020","Don’t waste your money, save it for buying a full switch. I wanted this unit because the regular switch is a bit bulky and awkward to hold when you’re using it like a handheld, my wrists start hurting after awhile. So I thought the lite would be perfect for me, and I became very disappointed with Nintendo the moment I tried to actually use it. The screen is very glitchy, and from a curious internet search it became apparent this isn’t a one off glitch- it’s practically a feature. For a product that’s supposed to tout phenomenal graphics, the lite is a disgrace. I’m so disappointed with Nintendo, this utterly ruins their image as a trustworthy company.","Screen glitch a common feature, don’t waste your money","Color: Coral Style: Lite Console","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S86nd2FCL._SY88.jpg

For a hundred dollars less, it does offer a lot, but if you want the total package, I still would have to recommend the regular switch since it has its docking abilities.

We've had no indication of that happening on our console :) There are ways to repair those joysticks should they start to ""stick"" but it would require taking the console apart.
