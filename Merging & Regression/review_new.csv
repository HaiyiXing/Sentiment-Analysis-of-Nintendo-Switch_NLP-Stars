2,23/8/2019,"Everything about the physical device, i feel like is pretty well made. Good set up, some minor future issues that are mitigated by screen protectors and similar. Several easy to work with ways to play it, kinda fun in its novelties on its build. My issue? 1) games are ridiculously expensive. So many are over priced. 2) Online play required by Nintendo for a not good service is poor. Especially for things like minecraft. 3) Where are any older games. The games that Nintendo has no need to keep out of the store. The old pokemon, Zelda games, or any games really. Like, great you are putting witcher 3 on there...But not Orignal Zelda and Ocherina of time? Physical? Great! Nintendo online and games? Bad. 1 or 2 games does not make the switch worth buying.

5,6/9/2019,"This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)). So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while. I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings. So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime). Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.","Counter({'switch': 8, 'nintendo': 4, 'game': 4, 'pc': 3, 'console': 3, 'skyrim': 3, 'graphic': 3, 'version': 2, 'little': 2, 'college': 2, 'play': 2, 'platform': 2, 'really': 2, 'yes': 2, 'love': 2, 'gameplay': 2, 'much': 2, 'better': 2, 'busy': 2, 'fun': 2, 'review': 1, 'model': 1, 'background': 1, 'enthusiastic': 1, 'gamer': 1, 'built': 1, 'purpose': 1, 'due': 1, 'demand': 1, 'adulthood': 1, 'someone': 1, 'occasional': 1, 'last': 1, 'handheld': 1, 'black': 1, 'white': 1, 'boy': 1, 'pocket': 1, 'early': 1, 'away': 1, 'bought': 1, 'purely': 1, 'learned': 1, 'ported': 1, 'huge': 1, 'fan': 1, 'elder': 1, 'scroll': 1, 'genre': 1, 'hoping': 1, 'devote': 1, 'train': 1, 'commute': 1, 'questing': 1, 'around': 1, 'tamriel': 1, 'sense': 1, 'disappoint': 1, 'connoisseur': 1, 'compared': 1, 'skryim': 1, 'well': 1, 'perceptible': 1, 'lag': 1, 'color': 1, 'crisp': 1, 'missing': 1, 'expansion': 1, 'text': 1, 'small': 1, 'fair': 1, 'portability': 1, 'brings': 1, 'far': 1, 'mariokart': 1, 'another': 1, 'throwback': 1, 'dorm': 1, 'day': 1, 'playing': 1, 'marokart': 1, 'obviously': 1, 'newer': 1, 'still': 1, 'sucker': 1, 'least': 1, 'next': 1, 'e': 1, 'released': 1, 'hopefully': 1, 'lifetime': 1, 'anyway': 1, 'say': 1, 'great': 1, 'adult': 1, 'want': 1, 'reminisce': 1, 'even': 1, 'year': 1, 'ago': 1, 'take': 1, 'seriously': 1, 'mean': 1, 'might': 1, 'right': 1, 'choice': 1, 'people': 1, 'concerned': 1, 'perfect': 1, 'experience': 1, 'dedicated': 1, 'make': 1, 'gaming': 1, 'go': 1, 'effortless': 1, 'average': 1, 'person': 1, 'something': 1, 'enjoy': 1, 'whole': 1, 'family': 1, 'think': 1, 'real': 1, 'goal': 1, 'along': 1})",0.134444444

The newer version shows the right red controller sliding up a little bit. When the Nintendo switch arrived at my house I was happy to see that it was the correct one showing the right red controller sliding up. The Nintendo switch that shows the right red controller sliding up has an extra 23 hours of portable battery life. Definitely worth the $500. Even if it is an extra $200. You can't get mad at someone being smart enough to stock up to make a profit. at least it's not some of these people that are trying to sell them for $1000. I would suggest purchasing Super Mario Odyssey as a game to go with it. It also comes with a 32 gig micro SD card. The Nintendo switch only allows you to use certain micro SD cards.

I bought an old Wii a few years back just for some party games (wasn’t a fan) and messed around with 3DS casually here and there but things changed when I got a Switch. It’s just absolutely brought me fully back into the gaming world. All of the Nintendo branded games are solid winners. Mario Odyssey was an amazing and fun game to test the waters with, Zelda BotW is the deepest and best game I’ve ever played, Astral Chain is awesome fun, Animal Crossing is causal and super relaxing, and there are SO many amazing ports from other consoles that it almost feels pointless getting any other system. If you want more serious/intense action RPGs Skyrim is massive, Assassin’s Creed is a blast, Dragon’s Dogma is an underrated classic, and there are endless other options. Also the best for multiplayer games - Super Smash, Mario Kart, Overcooked are some of my wife and I’s favorites. My friend lent me a PS4, and while the games are bigger and with better graphics, nothing really beats being able to play your game on the big screen then grab it and play it on the couch or on the go. So convenient, so good. Nintendo really nailed it on this one. Everything about it feels pretty perfectly designed. Battery life is about 4-5ish hours, just need to get a good sized micro-sd for digital games and you’re good to go. Seriously one of the best purchases I’ve made in a long time (Note - I bought my Switch a month before Covid hit so I got it for the standard price of about $300 - avoid the price gouged $400-500 price tags.

1,26/10/2020,"First, I'm going to start by saying there are a ton of things to love about the Nintendo Switch. The problem I have has more to do with the service provided by Nintendo. A company is not only judged by what they can produce but how they stand behind their products. I had a game card that started failing shortly after 90 days and so I contacted the Nintendo technical support. I was told the repair would be $30 and an additional $10 in shipping. I was also told it would take 5 weeks time for the repair. Now this is where I need to be pretty blunt. Asking me to pay $40 to repair a game card when the original game was only $49.95 is an absolute rip off and not a sound investment. Furthermore, you don't repair these kinds of game cartridges. Inside the card is usually a single IC chip soldered to a board so the chip can be read by the card reader. Even Intel does not ""repair"" their CPUs or other IC chips so it is easy for me to say Nintendo does not either. If anything, the unit will be replaced, which does not take 5 weeks. At this point, what adds insult to injury is the same game is available on the Nintendo eShop for $59.95. The digital download version of the game does not suffer the same issues with losing your game due to faulty cartridges. The use of digital copies has been huge for movies, and many of them give it to you for free. Nintendo has you pay more and it is a separate purchase as if you did not have the game to begin with. My issue here is I do not have any mechanism to backup my games to protect them without using the same tools used by bootleggers. I should not have to resort to such a tactic and Nintendo should do more to support my investment. Taking this one step further, I have issue with the fact Nintendo does not put any warranty information on the outside packaging so a buyer can be aware before making the decision to purchase their products. Even on Amazon, you are linked to another page and then referred to the manufacturer with no direct link. As a game buyer, whether retail or online, products are not very readily available for inspection. In standard brick-and-mortar stores, you have to get a sales assistant to review the package. Online, you are limited to what the retailer has decided to make available. In any case, I should not find out the details when I am most in need. So if you are buying into this game console ecosystem, there is more to the decision than how exciting their games are because the service is nothing but exciting and are at best reluctant to stand behind their products. I have given this product a single star because my decision to purchase the Nintendo Switch has been met with nothing more than being on my own after spending a lot of money. Excited gamers means lots of sales. Gamers who feel they have been taken advantage of simply have options with other consoles. I think you can guess which category I'm in and I hope you think twice about the company behind this one.","Counter({'game': 12, 'nintendo': 9, 'product': 5, 'repair': 5, 'card': 4, 'behind': 3, 'chip': 3, 'available': 3, 'issue': 3, 'purchase': 3, 'decision': 3, 'switch': 2, 'service': 2, 'company': 2, 'stand': 2, 'support': 2, 'told': 2, 'would': 2, 'take': 2, 'week': 2, 'need': 2, 'pay': 2, 'investment': 2, 'cartridge': 2, 'single': 2, 'ic': 2, 'even': 2, 'digital': 2, 'one': 2, 'buyer': 2, 'online': 2, 'sale': 2, 'console': 2, 'exciting': 2, 'nothing': 2, 'lot': 2, 'gamers': 2, 'think': 2, 'first': 1, 'going': 1, 'start': 1, 'saying': 1, 'ton': 1, 'thing': 1, 'love': 1, 'problem': 1, 'provided': 1, 'judged': 1, 'produce': 1, 'started': 1, 'failing': 1, 'shortly': 1, 'day': 1, 'contacted': 1, 'technical': 1, 'additional': 1, 'shipping': 1, 'also': 1, 'time': 1, 'pretty': 1, 'blunt': 1, 'asking': 1, 'original': 1, 'absolute': 1, 'rip': 1, 'sound': 1, 'furthermore': 1, 'kind': 1, 'inside': 1, 'usually': 1, 'soldered': 1, 'board': 1, 'read': 1, 'reader': 1, 'intel': 1, 'cpu': 1, 'easy': 1, 'say': 1, 'either': 1, 'anything': 1, 'unit': 1, 'replaced': 1, 'point': 1, 'add': 1, 'insult': 1, 'injury': 1, 'eshop': 1, 'download': 1, 'version': 1, 'suffer': 1, 'losing': 1, 'due': 1, 'faulty': 1, 'use': 1, 'copy': 1, 'huge': 1, 'movie': 1, 'many': 1, 'give': 1, 'free': 1, 'separate': 1, 'begin': 1, 'mechanism': 1, 'backup': 1, 'protect': 1, 'without': 1, 'using': 1, 'tool': 1, 'used': 1, 'bootlegger': 1, 'resort': 1, 'tactic': 1, 'taking': 1, 'step': 1, 'fact': 1, 'put': 1, 'warranty': 1, 'information': 1, 'outside': 1, 'packaging': 1, 'aware': 1, 'making': 1, 'amazon': 1, 'linked': 1, 'another': 1, 'page': 1, 'referred': 1, 'manufacturer': 1, 'direct': 1, 'link': 1, 'whether': 1, 'retail': 1, 'readily': 1, 'inspection': 1, 'standard': 1, 'store': 1, 'get': 1, 'assistant': 1, 'review': 1, 'package': 1, 'limited': 1, 'retailer': 1, 'decided': 1, 'make': 1, 'case': 1, 'find': 1, 'detail': 1, 'buying': 1, 'ecosystem': 1, 'best': 1, 'reluctant': 1, 'given': 1, 'star': 1, 'met': 1, 'spending': 1, 'money': 1, 'excited': 1, 'mean': 1, 'feel': 1, 'taken': 1, 'advantage': 1, 'simply': 1, 'option': 1, 'guess': 1, 'category': 1, 'hope': 1, 'twice': 1})",0.062610977
