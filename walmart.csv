5,2-Feb-20,I wanted a Nintendo Switch since the day it came out! Now i finally got it and it works perfectly and arrived early as well! I am loving this so much! Best purchase i ever made with no regrets!
5,2-Feb-20,A godsend...very hard to find and I had to pay top dollar but it was the highlight of my 10 year old's birthday...
1,29-Mar-20,"wont connect to my tv, everything else I own connects to my tv just fine. but the nintendo switch wont. nothing I do will fix it and I'm in the IT so I should be able to fix it just fine. Even the reps couldn't help over the phone or remotely"
4,30-Mar-20,"The bonus Ematic controller doesn't work at all. Even if it's a bonus/free item, it should STILL work. Not happy about this at all."
5,4-Apr-20,Nintendo Switch is just what I thought it would be! Straight entertainment out of the box. System was easy to set up and my daughters were able to be playing within 15 minutes. Directions were easy to follow and controls are similar to previous Nintendo systems. I love that you can play on the go as well as at home on the TV.
4,5-Apr-20,"Perfect gift for my 7 year old! The whole family has enjoyed playing. Only complaint is how much $ the games and add ons are (for example the micro SD card you have to buy, extra remotes, etc). It added up VERY quickly."
5,5-Apr-20,very good my granson really likes it. but we did not recieve the didital down load for smash brothers not sure what to do about that no refund but was charged no e-mail for it either.. but got charged for it.
4,7-Apr-20,"Delivered in 4 days. Just as described. The box he desplays is for the 2019 model HAC-001(01) and I was pleasantly surprised to receive exactly that. The only reason I gave him 4 stars instead of 5 is because the price is high. As you may know, many sellers have jacked up the prices. They are also displaying the box for the 2019 model but sending consumers the 2017 model (model HAC-001). This guy sent exactly what's displayed."
5,8-Apr-20,"The Nintendo Switch is a wonderful platform. I love the fact it can be used as a handheld, or a portable console, or with the television. It has a wide variety of games that could engage anyone. A con for the Switch or Nintendo in general is Nintendo's handling of DRM, if you have multiple people using multiple consoles, BUY THE PHYSICAL GAME CARDS. Digital copies work fine if there's one person on two consoles though. My only complaint was with the shipping which was on Wal-Mart as they shipped it the day before it was supposed to arrive, and it arrived a day late. Otherwise everything was as expected with the order."
4,9-Apr-20,"The Nintendo Switch itself was delivered in a timely fashion especially considering the large influx of online orders that were a result of COVID-19. However, I found it to be a bit disappointing that the prices were increased to profit more off of those who are largely affected by the pandemic and forced to work from home."
5,10-Apr-20,My family loves this system. And the capability of detaching the joypads is awesome for my daughters small hands.
5,10-Apr-20,The Nintendo Switch is super fun. I love that you can play Super Nintendo games for free. Got it to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons which is also super fun.
5,16-Apr-20,I loved this switch. Although it is the old model it is still very efficient and great. Ive been playing constantly through out this quarantine and I do not regret a single thing about this switch. The shipping was free and we extremely quick and I loved it. If I had to buy a switch for a friends or a relative i'd definitely come back here! 5/5
5,17-Apr-20,For the price I paid should had came with couple of free games and carrying case
5,18-Apr-20,"Grandkids love it. Cam join in games on line with subscription. One plays on ps4 in one room the other on switch in another room. We have extra controllers, it can be taken anywhere"
5,19-Apr-20,Arrived late but that was because of the covid virus making shipping slower. Arrive in perfect condition and I can't put it down. I would order from this company again.
5,23-Apr-20,I wouldn't pay more than the 299.00. Purchased for rainy days during quarantine. Our kid loves mario kart. Olympics was a little too complicated for age. The joy cons are good but one of them doesn't always sync properly to use steering wheel. Might just need to be put back on switch.
5,23-Apr-20,"Upon looking for a Nintendo Switch, I discovered that it had been sold out in many different stores. I searched all over Walmart and kept on checking every day to see if I can at least snatch a good deal. Fortunately, I found a system available through a third-party vendor, I purchased it and afterward decided to research more about the company I had just bought the item from. The reviews from past online purchases stated upon things such as the company having terrible service, never receiving the purchased item, being unpleased with the experience and etc. I was surprised to have just bought a very expensive item from a company that has ratings so poor. I became worried but nonetheless waited until my package came. Once it did, I had nothing to complain about. I was lucky to not have any bad experiences with my order despite the bad reviews. The system came tightly secured in a box and included the system in a new condition. And, the box itself did not come with any signs of mishandlings or damage. The Nintendo system itself has not given me any problems and it running very well. Overall, I was happy ordering from Ant-online and would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a product from them."
1,29-Apr-20,The handle is broken only after 2 weeks...Can't find any resource to contact the seller to get it fix..
5,3-May-20,"Came earlier than initially said, which is always a plus. Have had it a week and absolutely no problems!!! Glad I found one when all stores were pretty much sold out all the time."
5,6-May-20,"The Switch Console has been sold out for months, due to the pandemic. I have searched everywhere that may sell a Switch but no luck. Fortunately, Walmart finally stocked 4 days ago, as it reflected on their site, stating Some are in Stock in a Walmart Near me(NORTH YORK), instead of its usual Out of Stock notice. I came to the closest one next to me, the next morning, and luckily, it wasn't a website glitch. The friendly staff helped me and advised they have JUST receive shipments the night before (The night I checked), as well Animal Crossing(which apparently has been sold out too). I bought both the console and the game, and could not be any more happier. Do not loose hope, the Switch are always in stock, you just have to check daily, and you will eventually find out at retail/regular price. :) SAVE YOUR PENNIES, GO TO WALMART."
5,11-May-20,"One of the best investments you can make especially if you have been a long time fan of Nintendo and it's console history. The versatility of the system and joy cons makes it one of a kind, combining all the best features of a handheld device and a TV mounted device. Bought this as a part of a Walmart customizable package that included a backpack, game, and pin. Highly recommend."
5,12-May-20,"My 10 year old son's review: I think that it is a great console! Has 2 Joy-Cons for good single and multiplayer action, has some great compatible games and is pretty strong with the Joy-Cons, which give it more protection, the Joy-Cons are also good for Bluetooth gaming, and can be used with other Nintendo Switches (and the new Nintendo Switch Lite). Has some good games, and great ports/remasters/expensive anime. Take your time to buy the original and be happy, there is a News area, A little album area, to store videos, and pictures, via using the Snapshot button on the Left Joy-Con, or via a specific area on the Micro SD Card, which can be inserted inside the back of the Nintendo Switch, and there is also options to have up to 8 users, and the console is region free, so you can make different region accounts, and get exclusive games, I recommend this to everybody, it can really make your day, except when its dead."
2,12-May-20,"Well, love the Nintendo Switch and games, but the dock literally lasted 40 days and is now not connecting to the TV. The switch still works, a aftermarket portable connection to the TV works, but not the dock. tried all of the fixes on line (plugging it in a certain order, switching cables, etc) no joy. Then Nintendo says their warranty repairs are closed for Covid-19. Great $300 console plus $60 games + $200 worth of accessories to have a part break in under 60 days."
5,12-May-20,Love this system. So portable. Easy to hook up or move from room to room or even house to house. Prices are jacked up because of demand but still love it.
3,8-Jul-20,"I mean the console is great and I'd recommend it to anyone but $450? Really, Walmart? I don't understand why or how huge corporate sellers of this product can hike up the price $150 more than its retail price. Us people just wanna play games :( so stop playing games with us!"
5,11-Jul-20,"Birthday gift for my granddaughter, she loves it"
5,13-Jul-20,If you want a great handheld game the Nintendo switch is by far a great system ! Switches can come off and be replaced or hook to a TV and use them to play perfect for age appropriate kids and adults very easy to use and last awhile
3,16-Jul-20,"The product itself was as expected but the packaging is horrible. The box was smashed up and open in parts. Thankfully there was minimal bubble wrap and I mean minimal. The $500 Nintendo switch was 100 degrees as well, not insulated or air conditioned while traveling. Really dissatisfied for the price!"
5,18-Jul-20,For Animal Crossing! Finally got it after nearly four-month of waiting
5,21-Jul-20,Keeps my kid entertained. Make sure you buy the tempered glass. I like the fact that it is portable and that you can use it at home on the tv and the corners come off for multiple player. Very cool.
5,22-Jul-20,"Thank you guys so much for all your help and the perfect product, I just received it and have it charging . I was so worried it would not arrive on time since it went out two days ago but just like it said when i bought it it arrived on time , in PERFECT condition !!! I can not express my gratitude and happiness , thank you guys for all your help , definitely buying from tech electronics , thank you guys so much stay safe and awesome."
5,27-Jul-20,This order is amazing . it works very well and came out exactly like a normal nintendo switch . honestly it was 300$ when i ordered but its prize got raised which isnt that epic . when it was normal price me and my mother bought it and after it came we bought pokemon Sword for it and it works perfectly like a normal nintendo switch. 5 stars
5,27-Jul-20,Had been waiting for a while for the switches to be restocked and jumped on it as soon as I saw Walmart had a few in stock online. Didn't want to pay that ridiculous markup price people are selling them for when they go for $299. The system is definitely worth getting for both kids and adults.
5,28-Jul-20,"My son enjoys games and he recommends that this console can be used anywhere.He loves the flack that he doesn't have to sit in his room but can walk around ,travel and even take on trips and it is very reliable consol.Thank you Nintendo"
5,29-Jul-20,Awesome. Kids love it. Easier to get going than the PS4. Nintendo has so many awesome interactive games. We love it. I bought this in the pandemic so paid a higher price tag but it was delivered quickly and was well-worth the quarantine higher price because most stores were out of stock.
5,29-Jul-20,"Arrived in perfect, working condition even during a pandemic. Order was shipped and received in a speedy fashion. I'm very grateful! Highly recommend."
5,29-Jul-20,"Love the switch! Did not disappoint. Don't forget an extra controller if you don't what to use just one small joystick each. Extra controller highly recommended. Everything else you need comes in the box, except for games of course."
5,2-Aug-20,"I can see the appeal for this console, the nostalgia of seeing exclusives like Zelda to the portability it offers. Overall its a great console to have for light fun gaming."
1,3-Aug-20,Get warranty just got it a week ago and control is already not connecting
4,3-Aug-20,"Quick delivery, got there a few days before eta. Only reason it's not a 5 star is because its over priced due to the pandemic and it's high in demand. Other than that my 6 old loves it."
5,3-Aug-20,I want people to know I had a Perfect experience shopping online with Walmart I rate it 5 Stars! I recieved my merchandise quickly!!!
5,4-Aug-20,"Bought my son for xmas and he loves it, he brings it everywhere with him, that's one reason I got it where its perfect for on the go during traveling and what have you. Although it's a Pricey investment I recommend."
1,5-Aug-20,"Ive had the switch for only a week and have used it only 3 times total which all had been using it without the docket, finally I decided I would use the docket for the first time and it didnt work at all. It didnt send signal to any tv I tried it on. I even tried different HDMI cords. Ive only used the switch about 3 times and now the charger will not work! So disappointed :( What is the exchange policies on these??"
4,5-Aug-20,"The Nintendo works fine. But Walmart sold this to me for $409, when they are sold for $299. Im not sure why, but my daughter was begging me for it and I bought it. I didnt know until later I was duped out if $110. I got screwed without a kiss."
5,5-Aug-20,I found the impossible to find item! Shipped to my home in less than a week! Made for a very Happy Birthday
5,6-Aug-20,I am very impressed w/this item and the company it came from! My grandson is so excited. The company delivered it a day early
4,7-Aug-20,"This is a present for a birthday that hasn't happened yet. So it isn't officially opened. I peeked in the box, it all looks ok, but I can't justify 5 stars until the user gets her hands on it. I will say that the delivery was faster than promised, and the packing seemed adequate, at least, it all LOOKS unbroken. Again, hasn't been turned on yet."
5,7-Aug-20,Awesome system Daughter bought one and showed me it is little compact game system you can hook up to tv and play as a family or two can sit at a picnic table or they can play individuly in a car or at home...you can take it camping to.
5,8-Aug-20,Price was high but due to virus 19. Still worth every penny to see my niece smile. Delivered Super fast
5,9-Aug-20,"I searched for 5 months for a Nintendo Switch at MSRP and found it one night on Walmart.com. instead of paying some joker $399, $499 or more."
5,9-Aug-20,My 10 year old granddaughter was was excited about this as a birthday gift and has not put it down! Thank you! Much better than a Barbie Doll!
4,9-Aug-20,"New Nintendo switch, worked great. Only con is the high price. Though that is to be expected with the pandemic."
4,10-Aug-20,There was some delay in the delivery and that could be due COVID-19 but finally I got the product I was looking for months and thank you Walmart for that.
5,10-Aug-20,Easy setup; very user-friendly. 8-year old boy loves it. Fun to play. Downloading games is easy (but does take some time) ... be sure to get a microSD for storage. The device can only store a few games.
5,11-Aug-20,Item came as expected. It was timely and in new condition.
5,11-Aug-20,"Thanks to Walmart, finally have this console after many weeks searching. Walmart did great job getting supplies of this during the pandemic"
4,12-Aug-20,This item is hard to find. Well worth spending the extra money. It was delivered on time. Would have give a 5 star but the problem Is It didnt offer a warranty
2,12-Aug-20,"Nintendo switch is a great product, with a good selection of titles available but its was two much money I paid 495.00"
5,13-Aug-20,This product came perfectly as described and was shipped 4 days early which was a great surprise. We are very pleased and happy to have found one of these hard-to-find Nintendos. Thank you!!
5,13-Aug-20,"My Grandson loves it, UPS delivered it to the wrong street, but I have honest neighbors, and I found it"
5,14-Aug-20,Thank you so much Walmart you are the best i been trying to get it for a long time ️️..... thank you
5,15-Aug-20,"Im in love ! It came so fast, was a little Skeptical as its not sold from Walmart but I couldnt be happier. Brand new, packaged nicely. Thanks ! Its Christmas in the summer for sure"
1,16-Aug-20,We over paid for this going to send it back.
5,16-Aug-20,Very Fast shipping and the game is a lot of fun!! No problems with online orders at Walmart!!! Love it!
5,16-Aug-20,My daughter plays this every night with her boyfriend. She absolutely loves it. Really is fun for everyone!
5,17-Aug-20,Of of the switch is amazing! However I had to buy through a 3rd party vendor via Walmart website at a HUGE mark up. Ummm.... if it was a real supply chain issue then no vendors would have these things. Whatever... I got the new unit and college kiddo didn't have to skip a beat.
5,17-Aug-20,"The Nintendo Switch works great! I was so worried that there could be possibly anything wrong with it, but nope. It works great and it came with no cosmetic flaws. Im glad I could finally get it after looking for so long."
1,18-Aug-20,"I've been wanting a Switch for months and finally bought one only to find the dock missing when it arrived. I don't want to return it because I want the item, I just also want the dock is was supposed to come with."
1,18-Aug-20,Did not puck up. Item over priced. Found same item for 169.00 less elsewhere
5,18-Aug-20,I was hesitant about buying. But its fun for all ages. Easy to use. Only down side are the games and how expensive they are. But the graphics are amazing.
1,18-Aug-20,HDMI input is not working correctly
5,19-Aug-20,"Item was delivered to me quicker than originally planned. I was a little worried, ordering form a 3rd party seller, but everything was brand new, and well packaged upon arrival. Unfortunately, my daughter found one in stock, so I had to return this one. I am still awaiting for it to be received by the 3rd party, and refunded to my card. I was so pleased with how fast it got to me, I didnt want to return it."
5,19-Aug-20,"Absolutely loved it! Nothing was missing or broken. Started up right from the start, works perfect on my TV even though it's a little old. Worth the purchase. Glad to have my own!"
4,20-Aug-20,"Shipped really fast and came very well protected in the packaging and with the shipping service! Had to sign for it, so I know it would not get taken by porch pirates! Works perfectly, despite the normal issues (lagging joycons, short battery off the dock) that are common to all Nintendo Switches right now. It did cost more than when they originally came out, but that's supply-and-demand, I guess."
5,20-Aug-20,"Unlike other retailers who had a low price but not stock Walmart, well it may have had a slightly higher price, was able to get me the item quickly and exactly as described."
5,20-Aug-20,It came earlier than expected in great condition. Very satisfied with the service! My mom enjoyed it very much! Happy I found a switch finally after months of searching!
5,20-Aug-20,Its a real Switch and I found one. In summer of 2020. What else is there to say? I am ecstatic
4,21-Aug-20,I love my new switch. The only thing I wasnt too thrilled about were these scratch mark looking things on the switch screen when I opened my order an the box was pretty scratched up too but not getting too upset about it I was just more like oh what the. What happened here XD. Cuz I did have this mailed to me an maybe it got a little messed up during shipment but they should be more careful especially with electronics. Things happen and Besides Im mostly playing this on my big screen an not really gonna be using switch screen so other than that. Im in love!!!!
3,21-Aug-20,The fact I paid 125 dollars more than in store price aggravates me but my bonus daughter was super happy it arrived by her birthday
5,21-Aug-20,My kids are very happy. Its working very good. Arrived one week earlier. My kids used it for three weeks and its still in good shape. Good product.
4,22-Aug-20,The inavailability of product elsewhere left me in a tough spot for my son's birthday so I paid $381 vs the standard $299 everywhere else (not avail until Oct) but I was very happy it arrived 3 days earlier than promised. No factory seal on box.
5,23-Aug-20,"OMG, I love this game! I searched for the console for over a year and couldn't find one that wasn't totally overpriced. However, I did pay a little bit more because the game of sold out everywhere due to COVID. I also scored the Ring Fit Adventure...If you don't have these....you MUST get them. Awesome experience and great for exercise! I totally recommend!"
5,23-Aug-20,"Walmart provided this excellent third party seller to the world when we are under a pandemic. It was hard to locate a Nintendo Switch that wasn't too overly priced, but knowing that some of the money would go toward a good cause helped me to feel better about the purchase. The package arrived a lot sooner than expected. My child is extremely happy. Thank you!"
4,23-Aug-20,"Joycons started to have a drift 3 months later, when the console is too hot, you can hear the fan working and sometimes when console is cold and you turn it in, that noise is there"
4,23-Aug-20,It's a nice game but I had to return it I found a cheaper one marked $299 which is it's regular price at best buy.
1,24-Aug-20,"It's an amazing console and it came quickly. Leaving a 1 star review for having to pay scalper prices due to companies trying to use the increased demand during a global pandemic to gouge profits. If it is not urgent, like a birthday gift in my case, wait until stores restock it for the actual retail price of 299. I have two Switch consoles my self and love them dearly. Great handheld by Nintendo."
4,24-Aug-20,Good - delivered on time. Disappointed with nintendo box package condition as it arrived. It wasn't wrapped or taped to open. Glad the product is working...no games came with the bundle and it took few hours to connect nintendo server and get something to start with.
5,24-Aug-20,"I am happy with my purchase! I wanted a Switch for a while and they have been hard to find. I finally found one here and I was not sure what expect as it was sold through a third party. But it came in a timely manner and I am satisfied! Obviously the Switch is super fun and convenient. I understand now why it is called the Switch, because you can switch from handheld to playing on the tv so easily!"
2,24-Aug-20,The piece that attaches to the TV does not work. Very frustrating tryi g to figure put what the problem is. We have to assume the part itself is broken.
5,24-Aug-20,"Did not like that I was PRICE GOUGED purchasing this product, highly unethical paid twice the amount !!"
1,25-Aug-20,I bought this and received it horrible condition. Im not quite sure why they would send an item like this in a plastic shipping bag. It would have been sent in a box with bubble wrap. I plan to gift this and feel as though I cant!
5,25-Aug-20,Great for small hands! My kids love this game system. The games are so much better for kids than adults. The controllers are very small and hard to use.
5,26-Aug-20,"It came in on time, its just like any other Nintendo Switches. I love it! It connects to my tv just fine"
1,27-Aug-20,"We received this from New Generations today, and the Nintendo switch came with an outlet adapter that doesn't fit American adapters so we can't charge or use the Switch. VERY disappointing and worthless, so now we have to return and start the purchase process all over for our son who was so excited for this product."
1,27-Aug-20,Still awaiting my refund. Was informed I would get refund when item was delivered. Its been 2days now and still no refund! Overpriced found the device cheaper by another vendor'nn
5,28-Aug-20,Waited a long time for this to come back in stock. Love that you can connect to the TV and its a handheld system. Thats why I didnt buy the Lite model.
5,28-Aug-20,"Such a great investment for my kids, they loved it. It was easy to set up and was just as a Nintendo fan can expected!"
5,28-Aug-20,"It's a Nintendo console, the name is greatness in my gaming world. Setup was easy and converting to TV and handheld is simple."
1,30-Aug-20,"The switch is a great product of course. The item came quickly as well. However, the seller took a pending charge out of my account (which they stated they would), and then took the actual amount of the product out. It has been over a week, and my account is still being charged $810 for a $400 product. I am not a rich person, so this is a lot of money to me. I understand wanting to make sure the money is there before sending the item, but just drop the pending charge right away. This is a seller issue, and not my bank. It usually takes about 24 hours for a pending charge to drop from most places. BEWARE!!!! You will be charged double until they decide to drop the pending charge."
5,31-Aug-20,"Works well so far. I didn't like that the shipping package listed what was inside. I was afraid my husband would see it and that it would ruin the surprise, as it was a birthday gift for him."
5,31-Aug-20,I love this! This little machine is what helped bring our family closer. My daughter can play games with her grandmother and aunts and uncles in other states even. We all get in on game play. During this pandemic this was the best purchase we made.
4,1-Sep-20,My 15 year son bought the Switch with his own money. A first!!! He loves it. He has spent hours on Animal Crossing.
5,2-Sep-20,"Just what I wanted for my granddaughter for Christmas, at exactly the price I was willing to pay. Thank you, Walmart for having it in stock. Another major retailer had it advertised at this price, but had none of them available the day the flyer came out. It was exactly as advertised, and was shipped/delivered super quickly (I had it 2 days after I ordered it). Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!"
1,2-Sep-20,I purchased this as a gift. Be careful of the 15 day return policy. I missed it by just a few days snd found myself needing to sell if on my own. I will definetly pay attdntiln to marketplace sellers in the future!
5,2-Sep-20,"Love this system. Longer battery life than the original, super fun software library, and snazzy neon colors. So glad we got a second system--now I don't have to share with my husband."
5,2-Sep-20,Everything was intact and this was the best price for the console! They are hard to find but they are definitely worth it to pass the time and play all of the nintendo exclusives
5,3-Sep-20,"This a great system, the graphics looks great and the set up was really easy. Nintendo has made many 'must play' games from well known franchises like Mario Brothers, and Legend of Zelda. There is also amazing RPG games, small independent games, horror, you name it. I played the original Nintendo when I was a little kid in the early 80s and it's been a great ride! Highly recommend!"
5,3-Sep-20,"The kids love this. They play the same games over and over, but they love the different options of joysticks. The ability to all play at the same time is also a super plus. It is a pretty cool concept to be able to use a handheld and switch to a console while also being able to play with other players. The downside is that you have to buy multiple consoles if you want each kid to be able to play on their own. I was told that the ""Lite"" version can't be connected like the console can, so the cheaper option isn't necessarily better. I have played it and I also like the Switch, mostly because they have Zelda."
5,3-Sep-20,"You'll need to buy a screen protector to be safe, but it isn't expensive. Loading takes some time with different games, updates, and downloads (depending on your internet connection), but I 100% love my switch."
5,3-Sep-20,My 4 year old Grandson loves it! He is way ahead of me. We play for hours. Some of the games allow for 4 players. Good family time.
4,3-Sep-20,My son loves it. Everything was well package and couldn't wait foot the games to come. Arrived faster than I thought.
5,4-Sep-20,"If you have always dreamed of having a console on the go, this is it. Not only can you play games handheld on the go, but hooking it up to a TV for group play is awesome. A little pricey, but if you can't wait for the new one go ahead and get this one."
5,4-Sep-20,"I recently bought this for my daughter for her bday . I could not find it anywhere and when I looked again , Walmart happened to have it in stock ! Great waiting time , and arrived on time !"
5,6-Sep-20,"very fun games, but the screen is not as good or sharp as the xbox nor ps4, owell nintendo is nintendo, their games are fun and family friendly. very solid system."
5,8-Sep-20,"These official Nintendo controllers are more expensive than knockoff ones...but considering their quality its really worth it. Also, buy these in-person at a Walmart. Walmart's online price is almost $10 more."
4,8-Sep-20,"Ordered a nintendo switch from this seller, and I'm enjoying it! It was a bit overpriced, but switches are sold out nearly everywhere else so it was worth it."
2,8-Sep-20,"So sad, we are disappointed, thought the switch would work for us just like for other people that left 5 stars reviews, however it didn't worked for us, sometimes the screen friezes.. gave 2 stars because company refunded money without any issues."
5,9-Sep-20,"I have only played Mario Odyssey so far, but the system is really fun to play. I like the controllers and the different options I have in using them. The the system is sleek and easy to use."
5,10-Sep-20,"arrived in timely fashion. apparently, the price was marked up approximately $90 due to the unavailability of the product. I was very happy to receive it regardless."
5,11-Sep-20,"Came faster than expected, brand new, no problems. Pricy, but its expected considering its sold out almost everywhere else. Definitely recommend!"
5,14-Sep-20,12-year-old daughter loves the in tendo switch plays it constantly have four games for it now wish I could get another one at the price I got this one instead of the three
5,14-Sep-20,Perfect for fun singleplayer and multiplayer! You wont regret this purchase!
5,16-Sep-20,This was a great buy and much better price then others out there priced at $500-$600
5,17-Sep-20,Online ordering is quick and easy my item came in less than a week. Your able to have multiplayers up to 8 the whole family can play together . I love it. Additional controls are pricy but worth it.
4,17-Sep-20,Both Joy-Con are loosely when attach to the Switch. I don't like that feeling when I just use the switch alone instead of attached to the console. I know one of this day that I will have to get another set of Joy-Con.
1,17-Sep-20,"Ordered online and they canceled it, but they unit is still postes as available in a higher price. This is unbelievable not even worth 1 star."
2,18-Sep-20,The product is great. But for shipping and handling service was terrible. I tracked it both through Walmart and fed-ex. My packages was stuck in a facility for 3 days. Called fedex asked if I could go pick it up. Walmart would have been no help but I would have loved if they could have updated what was going on with my package. Or in the future switch to ups or something other then Fedex
5,18-Sep-20,"What is there not to like? I've had the Xbox 1 and the PS4 since they came out but put off on buying the Switch when it came out. I cannot play first person shooter games, it literally makes me sick. With so many games coming out that are first person I have recently ran out of options of things to play besides my old standbys. We had to drive 2 hours to get this because evidently there are some greedy jerks out there who buy all the stock and then resale for a profit. Unfortunately for me and them both I'm stingy. I still have less in gas and the console than I would have paid the inflated price. Jerks. Back to the console. I travel for work so I like that I can take the system with me and pass the time when I know I'm going to be waiting, it beats trying to read things on my phone. I really like that I can charge the controllers on the console itself and don't have to buy a separate stand that is going to be finicky about charging if they're not on there just so. I'm a bit behind on games but I'm not having any trouble finding titles to play that I enjoy."
5,18-Sep-20,It was a bit pricy but well worth the money. My nieces loved playing with it. It even came a day earlier than expected.
5,18-Sep-20,This is a Christmas present for my grandson who I know will absolutely love it
5,18-Sep-20,Came on time. Great price
5,20-Sep-20,"Lots of fun, easy to navigate menus, and a great selection of games make this a must have console. Be prepared to spend a lot on accessories and games."
4,20-Sep-20,Great game system for the entire family. Do your research before buying. There seems to be an increase in price for this system due to the pandemic.
5,20-Sep-20,This is a gift for my son so I'm not sure how well this specific system is but my older son got his last year and it's been perfect. Just make sure you get a screen protector.
5,20-Sep-20,It's a Christmas present. Haven't opened yet so cant rate it. I'm sure its fantastic
5,21-Sep-20,"Greatness comes for those who wait, and that's getting this item at retail price. It performs well, great library of games, a portable system that can be played on your tv as a regular console. Nintendo products never fall short of being excellent thus they are in high demand for a reason. This is the console to get, it will be highly collectable over time, and will never loose value. Get one at retail and do your hunting like i did. Its so worth it."
5,22-Sep-20,Love it. Been trying for months to get one. This thing is beast compared to my Switch Lite. Love the bigger screen and the docobility option. The joycons are even nicer in person.
5,22-Sep-20,Perfect! The wait was well worth it! Thank you Walmart for having it in stock to order online and having the ability to pick it up at my local Walmart store.
5,22-Sep-20,Worked really well arrived super fast
5,23-Sep-20,Pickup was super easy and everything was exactly the way it was supposed to be. Nothing was damaged and it plays beautifully! Such a fun console too! I love that it can change from at home/TV gameplay to on-the-go! Very convenient
5,25-Sep-20,The item is sold at its regular price. Unlike some who jack up the price. Look for - Sold and shipped by Walmart - as these are fulfilled by vendor wherein prices are regulated by Walmart.
5,26-Sep-20,"I got this as a gift for my oldest son he loved it so much i had to buy another one for my younger son, the games are on the pricey side but they enjoy this system very much. versatile and fast shipping I would recommend."
5,27-Sep-20,"I am enjoying this console very much! My only issue was not with seller but with the company. There was no set up instructions in the box. It was fairly easy to figure out, but still would have been better with set up instructions. Shipping was fast. I received it two days ahead of when it was due. I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,27-Sep-20,Bought this a couple months ago..everything was fine for a little bit now the blue joystick doesn't work and makes the game/player go in various directions. Have to recalibrate it multiple times each time I play. Very disappointing
5,28-Sep-20,"SUCH a good family game system. Great combination of portability, indie games through the shop, and of course excellent 1st-party Nintendo games. It's really the full package."
3,28-Sep-20,There isn't much instructions that come with each game that explain in more detail about how to use the controllers. It gets a little confusing about which buttons does what function for each game. The games themselves are interesting though.
1,28-Sep-20,The switch is great. Walmart is total garbage. Go elsewhere and stop supporting this immoral corporation
5,28-Sep-20,Gave this as a gift. I received the package in a box and everything came with it. Just as described. No complaints.
5,29-Sep-20,Brand new. Arrived very well packaged. Arrived a full week before it was scheduled to!!
5,29-Sep-20,"awesome my kids love it so much we bought 2 more for the kids. That way they can play without waiting on the other to finish. They love Heave go, Fortnite and Animal crossing. Give it a 5 star because I love hearing the kids have fun. Its compact with easy to hold controllers. Great price too."
3,29-Sep-20,The Switch requires newer Wi-Fi technology for it to properly connect to the Internet. The controllers will only last 6 months I believe. The individual games are pricey so be prepared to melt your CC.
5,29-Sep-20,"received item as advertised ""new nintendo switch"" delivered as scheduled no issues at all. I would recommend seller"
4,29-Sep-20,"Its a great system! My only complaint is controller drift. I thought that Nintendo had fixed this problem, apparently not."
5,29-Sep-20,"Ordered this for my son's birthday! It came sooner than expected! Walmart was the only place that had it in stock at the time, what a life saver!"
5,30-Sep-20,"I can't make heads or tails of this thing and beyond plugging it in, can do little with it. Fortunately for me I have a 12 year old who is willing to pilot the device. He and his friends enjoy it very much. The graphics, I am told, are excellent, the game play appears to evoke much smiling and excitement, and on long car rides, ""are we there yet?"" has been replaced with soothing silence. Highly recommend this device."
5,30-Sep-20,"Endless entertainment. If you are considering purchasing, I recommend going for it! Package came securely wrapped and in perfect condition. We have not been able to put it down - great for single player and multi player alike."
5,30-Sep-20,One of the few places that have this in stock! Ordered it on line and receive it in 2 days! Much quicker than Amazon! And at a lower price.
5,2-Oct-20,"I had been waiting for this to be restocked, as I wasn't going to pay the marked up price in the $300 range when they normally are around $299. I LOVE my Nintendo Switch Lite, so I thought I'd get the original system for more options. I wasn't disappointed. Plus it lets me play games like those in the Mario series (which I haven't played in YEARS) and Just Dance, which I LOVE for multiple reasons. A item. Only complaint is minor, as I had a bit of a delay in delivery and then we had Hurricane Laura which delayed me using it."
5,2-Oct-20,Switch works great and Walmart's delivery was fast and secure. Am so glad I was finally able to get my hands on one for retail price. Recommend anyone to order online from here.
5,2-Oct-20,Item was received intact and good condition.
5,2-Oct-20,Good console for everyone. A lot of games for kids and family fun
5,5-Oct-20,"Nintendo has done a great job creating a unique platform. It's great to see reinventions of old games along with many new creations. The games are a bit pricey, but that's how all game platforms are. This is sure to bring hours of entertainment."
4,6-Oct-20,It does not come with a game. There is not enough space to download games so make sure to buy the sandisk card meant for Nintendo switch. Do not buy a 1 terabyte it will destroy your game.
4,7-Oct-20,I like the short period on time it took to receive My order. I would recommend Walmart to all my family and friends.
2,7-Oct-20,Is this a new switch or refurbished
1,8-Oct-20,"I was so excited to see these back in stock. I ordered it without hesitation. Then after going to Walmart and seeing that they were in stock there also I purchased it for $100 cheaper, I understand Walmart collabs with companies but that is ridiculous, I sent it back. But the Swith itself is great. Just becareful on prices."
4,8-Oct-20,"Quick shipping, well packed. The console is easy to setup and use and fun to play. Games are pricey, but I expected that. There are some ""bargain"" games available, so you could get hours of gaming pretty cheap if you wanted, but if you want to play the big name games (Kart, Party, Smash Bros, Animal Crossing, Zelda, etc.), you gotta shell out $60 a game. What really ticked me off was the $5 a month charge to play online. I bought the console for playing with my family remotely, since, thanks to COVID, we don't see each other often, so I pretty much had to pay the reoccurring charge for this service. Considering the price of the console, then the games, then extra controllers, etc etc this extra charge is ridiculous. After buying just two games, I'm $420 into this console already, now I have to pay $60 a year? I knocked off a star for that."
5,9-Oct-20,"Nice console for children As an adult, I would not buy it for myself as most games are pretty primitive. But kids love it. I love them loving it because they don't sit in one place but rather constantly moving"
4,9-Oct-20,Great item. Came with everything but did not feel brand new. Felt like packaging was for refurbished item
5,10-Oct-20,I love the Switch. This is my second one. First one still works. I just wanted two. Great game system. I thought the screen would be too small to enjoy playing games on...I was wrong.
5,14-Oct-20,"very fun games, but the screen is not as good or sharp as the xbox nor ps4, owell nintendo is nintendo, their games are fun and family friendly. very solid system."
5,17-Oct-20,"My girlfriend had wanted one of these for a very long time, and I noticed all the amazon switches were sold with a UK version of the AC adapter, so I looked on walmart. I was a bit worried that the package wouldn't be handled carefully given the other reviews, but when I got it within 2 days I was really happy. Fully functional, no issues, super fast delivery. Very happy overall"
5,17-Oct-20,Exactly what I ordered! Also got delivered a day earlier than expected.
1,20-Oct-20,It was broken when it arrived have had it charging for 3 hours now still will not power up at all screen has scratches in it looks refurbished supposed to be new very disappointed as it was a gift for my daughter..pretty devastated as a dad who promised his baby girl this...now the company I guess Wal-Mart went through to get this is making it difficult to return
5,21-Oct-20,This is a Xmas gift so I only Checked to make sure that nothing was damaged My grandchildren already have one and love it
4,21-Oct-20,My kids love it and having non stop fun. My younger one is juz 5 years old and she is able to learn quickly . GREAT PRODUCT
1,21-Oct-20,I didn't have it for too long and it's already having problems not charging
4,22-Oct-20,"very fun games, but the screen is not as good or sharp as the xbox nor ps4, owell nintendo is nintendo, their games are fun and family friendly. very solid system."
4,22-Oct-20,i love the machine very much! it's fun to play with kids and it can install bunch of games through downloading using wifi. and the mario cart is a legend. we can play it all day.
3,22-Oct-20,Pretty large for younger smaller hands. Glorified game boy at a much higher price. It is good if you have an Extra $300 or you play games 24 /7 but I bought as a gift. I am hoping that this most expensive gift is worth it.
4,22-Oct-20,Fun to play with family and online. Just unfortunate they don't have as many main stream games as the other consoles do.
5,22-Oct-20,e all love playing the switch..its fun for all ages and its portability makes it fun on the go as well
5,22-Oct-20,Very easy to set and begin playing immediately.
5,22-Oct-20,Much cheaper than on Amazon!
5,23-Oct-20,Came in a reasonable time
5,24-Oct-20,Good game. My 8 years old love it
5,24-Oct-20,I like that the $299.00 set has everything you need to get started
1,25-Oct-20,The box did not connect to TV. I had to send it back and I am still waiting on refund. The serial numbers on box and console did not match so that was another headache. Walmart can do better.!
5,25-Oct-20,"I got this for work as a hand held system to play during slow times. And it has been great. Its easy to use, great graphics and games."
5,25-Oct-20,Got an amazing deal and especially when it was out of stock everywhere I got it for a very discounted price
5,25-Oct-20,Love the Nintendo Switch. Easy to set up and easy to use
5,25-Oct-20,This is a gift and I loved fast shipping and price Im sure he will love it
1,25-Oct-20,Less than one year old and wont work
5,26-Oct-20,"I first bought a Switch when it came out, but wasn't playing it much so I gave it to my daughters. Then, in March 2020, we had this thing called a pandemic happen, and we all had to shelter in place to a few months. So I looked into buying one again to pass the time. It was sold out everywhere, and when you DID find one, it was marked up 150%, Amazon, eBay, you name it. After being persistent, I found it at Walmart at the MSRP. Glad, now I have something to do beside watch TV all day."
5,26-Oct-20,"I bought this unit for my wife and she seems to love it. I myself am not a gamer, but she's an enthusiastic player, so I guess I would recommend this unit based on her level of enjoyment!"
4,27-Oct-20,"Likes: -Able to play on Nintendo Switch console, or connect console to TV with HDMI, and play watching the screen of TV -HDMI included -Joy cons allow more than one person to play Minor Dislikes: -There are not many games capable for the use of the joy cons"
5,27-Oct-20,"I love my new switch, Im glad I bought it, and Im also really glad I was able to get it in my favorite color :"
5,27-Oct-20,Real fun game system. My son loves it.
1,27-Oct-20,I bought this and it said they had it and they just canceled it last second
5,28-Oct-20,Make sure you buy a memory card with it
5,28-Oct-20,Finally got one after the shortage of 2020. As expected. Great fun
4,28-Oct-20,"I'm very satisfied and I have no complaints about this console, I would recommend it to anyone"
1,1-Nov-20,The product model is not the same as what is listed on the product description
5,1-Nov-20,Arrived on time and was exactly what we wanted
5,2-Nov-20,"It was delivered on time and even a few days earlier than expected. My son was super thrilled for his gift. He had played friends' consoles and loved the switch for its ease of travel and switching to a tv at home. The games are a little expensive as most are, but overall very happy with the product."
5,2-Nov-20,Nintendo has a good selection of games that are less killing type of games. I choose this for the variety of non violence games you can offer the kids.
5,3-Nov-20,Gift for my daughter who LOVES it!
5,5-Nov-20,A great console for the kids and you can play in any place as long as you have battery
5,6-Nov-20,My Whole Family loves this item and it is a great gift
5,7-Nov-20,It's a fun console I play smash bros ultimate on it and it's an amazing experience very fun
5,8-Nov-20,this is amazing just buy this already
5,9-Nov-20,Love playing on this with m grandchildren. My grandson set it up. Was easy for a teenager to do
5,10-Nov-20,My kid is so happy! Animal Crossing on the switch is a winner!
5,11-Nov-20,Came in perfect condition and came very fast
5,12-Nov-20,"I love my Nintendo switch Lite. But I decided that I love it so much I would get the regular switch. Everything works amazing, it came with the HDMI cable, power cable, the dock, two straps for the joycons, you also got the joycon controller with it. I do definitely recommend this. But it is a little bit more pricier."
5,13-Nov-20,"So far ,so good !!! My kids waiting a long time for this Nintendo and finally they got it .Arrived 6 day before expected and is Brand New ."
