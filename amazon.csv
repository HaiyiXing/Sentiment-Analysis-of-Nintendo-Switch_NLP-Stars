5,28-Oct-20,Very pleased with product. Is as described.,Excellent service.
1,26-Oct-20,Did not come with 32 GM memory card as advertised.,Lied About Memory Card
1,26-Oct-20,"First, I'm going to start by saying there are a ton of things to love about the Nintendo Switch. The problem I have has more to do with the service provided by Nintendo. A company is not only judged by what they can produce but how they stand behind their products. I had a game card that started failing shortly after 90 days and so I contacted the Nintendo technical support. I was told the repair would be $30 and an additional $10 in shipping. I was also told it would take 5 weeks time for the repair. Now this is where I need to be pretty blunt. Asking me to pay $40 to repair a game card when the original game was only $49.95 is an absolute rip off and not a sound investment. Furthermore, you don't repair these kinds of game cartridges. Inside the card is usually a single IC chip soldered to a board so the chip can be read by the card reader. Even Intel does not ""repair"" their CPUs or other IC chips so it is easy for me to say Nintendo does not either. If anything, the unit will be replaced, which does not take 5 weeks. At this point, what adds insult to injury is the same game is available on the Nintendo eShop for $59.95. The digital download version of the game does not suffer the same issues with losing your game due to faulty cartridges. The use of digital copies has been huge for movies, and many of them give it to you for free. Nintendo has you pay more and it is a separate purchase as if you did not have the game to begin with. My issue here is I do not have any mechanism to backup my games to protect them without using the same tools used by bootleggers. I should not have to resort to such a tactic and Nintendo should do more to support my investment. Taking this one step further, I have issue with the fact Nintendo does not put any warranty information on the outside packaging so a buyer can be aware before making the decision to purchase their products. Even on Amazon, you are linked to another page and then referred to the manufacturer with no direct link. As a game buyer, whether retail or online, products are not very readily available for inspection. In standard brick-and-mortar stores, you have to get a sales assistant to review the package. Online, you are limited to what the retailer has decided to make available. In any case, I should not find out the details when I am most in need. So if you are buying into this game console ecosystem, there is more to the decision than how exciting their games are because the service is nothing but exciting and are at best reluctant to stand behind their products. I have given this product a single star because my decision to purchase the Nintendo Switch has been met with nothing more than being on my own after spending a lot of money. Excited gamers means lots of sales. Gamers who feel they have been taken advantage of simply have options with other consoles. I think you can guess which category I'm in and I hope you think twice about the company behind this one.",Love Product but Not the Company
5,24-Oct-20,My son wants a switch for Xmas. I knew I had to get one before November and the holiday shopping rush. These things have been in short supply since the beginning of the year. I paid $80 more than I should have. I'm not happy about that. I'm sure it's a great system.  I just don't like paying ridiculous money for things.,I'm sure it's great. Paid 80 bucks over retail.
3,23-Oct-20,"So, the switch is just about perfect. Only problem: it doesn’t want to connect to any dock. I’ve tried repeatedly and done extensive research, but to no avail. Other than that issue, everything else is nice. The package came unsealed and looked like it had been opened before, which isn’t what I paid $400+ dollars for. But everything looked well enough that I let it go. If I was really desperate for the dock connectivity, this would have been a no-go, and it would have immediately went back. Luckily, I can live without out it. Just be weary of buying a switch on amazon. 7/10 it’s done right, but that other 3 you’ll get an switch that is a dud in one way or another.",Doesn’t connect to dock.
1,22-Oct-20,"they’re lucky i love my kids more than my money or else i wouldn’t support price-gougers, everything works fine though, but i also didn’t get the extra 32gb sd card as they promised","Price-Gouging, Didn’t Come With Promised SD Card"
5,22-Oct-20,😄,😊
5,21-Oct-20,"Bought this for my son. Loves it. Good battery life, able to play with several people.",Great value for the money spent.
5,21-Oct-20,It's really a good game for my little brother. But one tiny problem. Does it has to have a 32G SD card? When I open it it got everything but except the SD card. And I don't know if I should contact the owner and tell him. My parents or my brother doesn't know it but if they do. They will be mad.,I would like to no if it really comes with a SD card?

4,21-Oct-20,"This is a real switch, It comes in the updated red box. The box included everything but the sd card. I recommend getting a sandisk or samsung card because the 32 gb of internal storage will not be enough.",Does Not come with a micro sd card
1,21-Oct-20,"This product was advertised as BRAND NEW, but the box was clearly opened. Pretty lame for something marked up as high as it is.",NOT in brand new condition
4,20-Oct-20,"Not only is this more expensive than MSRP, which is fair considering a shortage and the fact everyone wants one, but the main issue is that this is supposed to include a 32 gb memory card. It did not, and looking at other reviews, many people have had the same issue. Edit: update, the seller responded to my message, and said they would send the memory card. They were extremely apologetic, so it seems to have been an error of some sort. Will update review and rating again once I receive the memory card. Edit #2: Memory card was delivered, 32 gb micro that was the correct type. Updated to 4 stars, as while issues were corrected, there were still issues. Otherwise, everything works great and would recommend. Just make sure everything is in order when you receive your items.",Missing memory card
5,19-Oct-20,"Overall the product came in great, had it for about a month now and I still have no problems",Simple review
5,19-Oct-20,Standard switch,Great
5,18-Oct-20,Great to see retailers restocking them. Becoming more and more readily available. If you want one head on down and get your switch at a fair price. Switch is an awesome console for home and on the go.,Restock and availability is good again
5,13-Oct-20,bought for my sons 10th birthday. this was literally the only supplier whom did have it ... my son loves it. i also enjoy playing with him we're stuck on super smash bros. 😊,loved it
5,12-Oct-20,Actuallly was a great pirchase and in so glade i bought mine when i did. The prices have gone so far up. So great purchase i really recommend this buy. Received it fast and in perfect condition.,Greatest purchase ive order on here by far
4,11-Oct-20,"Battery life amazing, value for money will be playing for years. It’s perfect and I usually hate everything.",It’s exactly what I wanted and more.
3,9-Oct-20,"I was hesitant to purchase due to fear of it not being authentic but it was. It is version 2 & DID NOT come with a memory card, I believe it just means the BUILT-IN STORAGE. Everything looks brand new and is packaged well. Very pleased it came in 2 days, instead of a week as it was estimated with free shipping. Very pleased, but will be returning due to being way overpriced, and the Nintendo store is set to have more in stock soon.","Real Switch, 2 day shipping, Over Priced"
5,7-Oct-20,Great console for both on the go and stationary use. I can keep it plugged in with the dock to my tv or take it on the go without being too worried about battery life.,Great Console

5,6-Oct-20,"Bought this for my son and the way he is enjoying it, I must say it is value for money!  Threaten to take it away from him and he gets on his best behavior.  Lol",definitely value for money!
3,6-Oct-20,Great product! My daughter loves it! However after 1 day of use it would not charge. We are exchanging and hopefully will be able to enjoy it once again. Great value if it will charge!!,Did not charge after 1st day
5,6-Oct-20,Mas costoso que en Best Buy pero buen juguete,Muy buen
1,6-Oct-20,Me dieron un mes de garantia y acaba de terminar la garantía hace. 2 s semanas y el Nintendo switch ya no sirve y ahora me dicen que la garantía ya termino page mas de 400 dolares,No trabaja ya el Nintendo switch y dicen que la garantía ya paso
5,5-Oct-20,I can't believe how technology has changed. But you wouldn't believe the sheer joy that this brought my son. It was worth every cent . No more tiny screen mobile devices.,Awesome gift to give you gamer geek.
2,5-Oct-20,not what i thought it would be for the money,review
5,4-Oct-20,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Exactly what I wanted, though overpriced. Has excellent battery life, came with all the accessories mentioned, and shipping was quick. This is a legit Nintendo Switch but priced to market value instead of actual value. My husband was very happy to receive this and has had no issues with the function of the device.",Real Nintendo Switch but Overpriced
5,3-Oct-20,"only disliked about the description was the extra memory card didn’t come with it. you’ll have to message the seller to ask them for a refund or to ship it back to you. but overall everything works prefect. i haven’t encounter any problem yet, hoping for none since i didn’t get any protection plan. i had it for almost a week now!",Amazingly satisfied!
4,1-Oct-20,"love it!! although it did not come with the sd card, i still love my switch. obviously its not usually priced at $400 but i get it, everybody wants one. i only gave it 4 stars because of the fact it didnt come with the sd card. but i still love it!!","didnt come with sd card, but still love it!"
1,1-Oct-20,"This is still overpriced at the time, where you can go look elsewhere on amazon and get the switch for 300 dollars like it’s supposed to be",Trash
1,1-Oct-20,Wasn't clear on what version. Box is for new I received old.,Incorrect description
3,30-Sep-20,Price is too high,"Good product, bad price"
5,28-Sep-20,"I chose to have some fun while at home, now that the kids are all grown and I have some time.  I chose Nintendo because it had a lot more non-violent/non-violent games than Ps4 - (love love Yonder, trying Zelda next). I bought the Switch.  It's FUN!  Super easy to hook up and get started. It's portable, it takes up very little space, it can be handheld like a tablet, it can be used for actual workouts!!, it can hook up to the tv and be multi-functional there too. It's easily adaptive to solo or multi-players in ways I have yet to explore. -  I am loving Yonder, will try Zelda next. Great fun!",Newbie gamer - bought a switch!  Perfect for this ol person!
4,27-Sep-20,The product came MUCH faster than expected by almost a week. Product came in perfect condition. No parts were damaged or non functional. I set everything up in a matter of minutes and everything is great so far. My only concern is that the product is INSANELY expensive. Should’ve at LEAST come with some accessories for this price point,Great product but overly pricy
4,26-Sep-20,"Ok yes the price is way more then it should be, but because I’ve been looking in stores for awhile and none has one this was the best option. It came with everything except the Micro SD card but some people did get one. I hooked it up to my tv and everything is working, my account linked and all I needed to do was redownload my games, but until I get another SD card I can’t play a lot of them. So yes there is a rick something goes wrong or doesn’t come with something. The shipping was amazing! Came in 4 days earlier and packaging was good. I haven’t tested the battery life yet on how long it lasts. So other then the SD card not included and the slight over price it was worth it! Especially since some switches on amazon cost more, this was the lowest I could find but it still went over $400 so be prepared!",All good but a couple problems

5,24-Sep-20,Llego en perfecta condition.,Super comoda tamaño perfecto

5,23-Sep-20,"No memory card, packaged nicely though and nintendo switch works. Was under the impression we got a 32gb memory card with it though",No 32gb memory card.
3,21-Sep-20,"Bought the Switch for Christmas 2017.  It's Sept. 2020 and I just purchased the third set of Joycon.  Bought the 2nd set of Joycon while I sent in the original Joycon in for repair.  Had to buy a third since both left Joycon drift , so we needed a third set.  Nintendo repair service is backed up, so buy  back up Joycon or just don't buy the system in the first place.  It's too bad it's a good system, the  Joycon are just poorly designed and made.",Joycon don't last!
4,21-Sep-20,"I got it for my fiance. She LOVES it. Sadly, I did pay $457 for it.  It works flawlessly, but the price is just outrageous. If you're really interested in getting one, go to your local Gamestop.  You can pick one up for $300 if they're in stock.","Solid product, but way overinflated price wise"

5,20-Sep-20,Yego completo y fue una buena inversión,Me gusta
3,19-Sep-20,"Everything about this is great accept the battery life and joycons. The joycons drift like crazy for no reason and the thing lasts a lousy 4 hours on full charge. And this is a handheld so it should last at least 8 hours. Also the dock scratches the screen. At this price there should be less of this. (I'm Mary's son, mary is her account name)",Great but bad for the price.

2,3-Sep-20,I don't think people should have to pay more than retail for a product. Unless you are desperate to play a game on this system I would suggest patience and wait till they are back in a regular amount of stock. Of course I am not here to judge people who want to spend that kind of money I just personally don't think it is worth and going by the comments some of you seem to regret it. Nintendo just announced next year there will be an updated Switch which to me makes it even less worthwhile.,An updated Nintendo Switch comes out next year.
1,3-Sep-20,"I WAS going to buy one but the price is way to over priced. This is not even Nintendo selling these, a vendor is buy them all up and re-selling them at a horribly high cost. You would be wasting your money buying this even if Is money that you are getting from unemployment /stimulus Check. Please do better and look else where it’s not worth it",Do not buy this!!!
1,3-Sep-20,It's overpriced and a waste of money. DO NOT BUY WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR!,WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR!

I'm not to happy.  was a pleasant for adoption day and had games to download and not enough space for last game because no extra card.  false advertising is against the law so fix or send the sd card.,not as discriped

5,7-Aug-20,Well the good news it that this looks to be the newer version. Bad news is that you pay $100+ over the regular price of 299.00 I did received the SD card which i saw lots of reviews saying they didn’t. You have to look for it since it is not just out there. They did slide it in the switch box. Over all it is what it is supply and demand. So far the switch box came previously opened and looked fairly new or refurbished? Will continue to use it and it will hopefully continue to go well,Supply and demand
5,5-Aug-20,"I am aware that everyone is complaining about the price due to being able to buy it for $299 in store, but obviously it's difficult to do that when it's in such high demand, and I can understand why!

2,3-Aug-20,Way too expensive and it was missing memory card. The memory card would at least make up for some of the overpricing. Very misleading sale.,Overpriced and missing parts
5,2-Aug-20,I can't speak on this too much personally it was a present for my daughter but she has had every console that has come out in the last 20 years and she cannot stop raving about this. From our perspective it is fantastic,A present for my daughter. Great buy
5,2-Aug-20,My boyfriend wanted one of these soo bad so i finally decided to get it for him and let me tell you that it was the best decision i ever did we used to fight about the ps4 lol but not he plays fortnite with me from the nintendo it takes a long time before the battery dies out and everything is soo portable,Definetly Worth it
1,1-Aug-20,"I've owned Nintendo products my whole life. I was 2 when the NES released and had my first one when I was 6. I love Nintendo consoles and games. I love that I can leave my kids to play with them and not worry about inappropriate content. We bought our first switch just over a year ago. We loved everything about it from the mobility to the graphics. Mario kart became an instant family tradition. Unfortunately, the charging port went out, just after warranty. One thing we've come to love from Nintendo is the durability. I have an original NES that still works. We have a WII that's 15 years old and still going strong. To only get a year out of a $400 console is unacceptable.  I've been told that it likely can't be repaired, as the motherboard is so thin it doesn't accept new soldering without blowing through it. Now we are stuck with a $400 paper weight. Super disappointed.",Expected more
5,1-Aug-20,"The Nintendo Switch! You know it's good it's pretty expensive at the time but that doesn't matter. What matters is that this is Nintendo's best console for this generation and if you're stuck at home bored then play this. It has great games like Smash Ultimate, Breath of the Wild & Animal Crossing New Horizons you can even watch YouTube on here! Honestly Nintendo did an excellent job at making this console despite it being expensive right now. Definitely my 2nd favorite console and would pick this up. Although it is sold out at a lot of places look over here and if it's really desired or you just want a switch cuz well it's a switch would 100% recommend this.",It's a little expensive at the time but still great console

Too bad the price is $130 more than what they originally sold for, but considering everyone wanted these during a pandemic, this was the best price I could find. I actually ordered one from another seller and they returned my money because they weren’t able to fulfill my order. I was very happy these guys were able to get the switch to me right away.","Great gaming console, brand new and fast delivery!"
5,28-Jul-20,"Works really well, and charges fast. Easy to set up for the most part. My only thing is that I feel like it's too expensive, but maybe that's just me.",Happy
5,27-Jul-20,Maravilloso,Muy bueno
1,25-Jul-20,Been waiting to find this and hurt to pay that much but I figured “hey it’s going to come with a 32 GB card and my kids are going to love it why not?” The switch came but there was no 32 GB card in the box! Really irritated by this and the customer service that amazon gave me.,Ridiculous!
1,25-Jul-20,Device arrived with a malfunction. VDI external port did not work. Return the device and was given less than $200 for what I paid for. No explanation as to why the reduction. First time I have run into this situation. I do not recommend purchasing from this vendor.,It a good experience with Vendor.
5,25-Jul-20,We were so happy to find this console as NEW! They were sold out everywhere and my daughters bday couldn’t wait. It came before promised and we have had it for about6 weeks. No issues so far!,Bday surprise
5,25-Jul-20,Works amazing,Basically new
3,24-Jul-20,I am happy I have a switch finally but hate that it costs $200+ more than they’re worth. One thing to add on is I didn’t get the additional memory card like I paid for but saw other people had gotten theirs???,Cost sucks...make sure you get everything you pay extra $$ for
5,24-Jul-20,I am really having fun with. Great game!,Switch
4,23-Jul-20,"My switch came just as expected. Brand new, perfect working condition, and is the newer model in the red box. My memory card was included. I’ve been hunting for one for months so I was willing to pay more at this point, but it’s a shame the way the prices are inflated. I’ve heard of people getting scammed on amazon with switch consoles but luckily this was not the case. If you’re willing to pay more, then this is a good company to order from.","Brand New, but overpriced."
5,23-Jul-20,Received the red box (v2),Good except for the price
5,23-Jul-20,Too easy worth it,🔥
5,22-Jul-20,"I love it! It was fast and easy to set up, the price was a bit high. It came with everything plus a SD card (I wasn’t sure if it was included or not), it’s light and easy to use. The only think I didn’t like but isn’t a problem for me was the peg that pops out the back is hard for me to use but I figured it out 😁.",I Love Mine!
5,22-Jul-20,It came quick and at a great price tbh. Most people are saying it is expensive but they need to understand that this product is having a shortage and may be discontinued. It has a high demand right now and I am glad I could find one. Sold out at all GameStop’s and other stores. It was my daughter’s birthday gift and she loved it. Some people are charging 500+. Thank you so much for having this product at a great price and not over abusing the market.,Great price and product!

5,18-Jul-20,Worked as expected and arrived a little early than expected.,Good
3,17-Jul-20,I really dont  have anything bad to say the only thing I would say is the price and never recieved the memory card. Otherwise my son loves it and works well.,Never recieved the memory card
4,17-Jul-20,I'm not going to comment on price. Is what it is. Supply and demand. I had 2 concerns 1)Was I actually going to receive the product and 2) was it a V2? Yes. I did receive it and it was a V2.,It is real

5,14-Jul-20,Great product. I'm a long time gamer and Nintendo lover and this console delivers. Speaking of delivery it was projected to arrive like a week+ later than I got it. I know that kinda thing varies but seeing that it was delivered yesterday was an incredibly pleasant surprise to wake up to.,Great Console. Surprisingly fast arrival.
1,14-Jul-20,I absolutely loved the price.....yeah no only if you make as much as mario collecting coins on a bonus level.... Really?!,Lol
4,14-Jul-20,"I know this is overpriced.  I was OK with paying it.  Here is my only complaint, it did not come with the memory card.  So, it is not as described.  I could have purchased this lesser edition for $417.00.  However, I wanted the 32 GB video game with memory card, so I paid extra.  This is the first time ever I did not get what I paid for on Amazon. I did my homework.  I read the reviews.  I did see that one other person did not get the memory card.  So I guess I am not the only one who was taken advantage of.",Not exactly as advertised- Memory card not included
1,14-Jul-20,"Poor Quality Product and untrustworthy. I received a faulty item, tried to resolve problem with patients and left out to dry. With a very high price to start with on product , I ended up with less than in the end. Buyer beware!",Poor Quality Product and Untrustworthy.
5,12-Jul-20,"Honestly, I’m in love. I haven’t really had a real current-gen console since college (about a decade). I bought an old Wii a few years back just for some party games (wasn’t a fan) and messed around with 3DS casually here and there but things changed when I got a Switch. It’s just absolutely brought me fully back into the gaming world. All of the Nintendo branded games are solid winners. Mario Odyssey was an amazing and fun game to test the waters with, Zelda BotW is the deepest and best game I’ve ever played, Astral Chain is awesome fun, Animal Crossing is causal and super relaxing, and there are SO many amazing ports from other consoles that it almost feels pointless getting any other system. If you want more serious/intense action RPGs Skyrim is massive, Assassin’s Creed is a blast, Dragon’s Dogma is an underrated classic, and there are endless other options. Also the best for multiplayer games - Super Smash, Mario Kart, Overcooked are some of my wife and I’s favorites. My friend lent me a PS4, and while the games are bigger and with better graphics, nothing really beats being able to play your game on the big screen then grab it and play it on the couch or on the go. So convenient, so good. Nintendo really nailed it on this one. Everything about it feels pretty perfectly designed. Battery life is about 4-5ish hours, just need to get a good sized micro-sd for digital games and you’re good to go. Seriously one of the best purchases I’ve made in a long time (Note - I bought my Switch a month before Covid hit so I got it for the standard price of about $300 - avoid the price gouged $400-500 price tags. You can find it cheaper elsewhere or just wait for the price to go back down)",Simply The BEST Console
5,11-Jul-20,"I normally don’t pay this much for entertainment purposes, but it came it amazing condition, came a week early and is really easy to set up. I recommend it.",It’s expensive but worth it
1,9-Jul-20,"False advertisement, was suppose to come with a 32GB MicroSD card. But nowhere to be found, very disappointed... would not recommend",WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
5,8-Jul-20,I hate the fact that the price was raised so much but 🤷🏻‍♀️. Product is great,Amazing
5,8-Jul-20,My daughter loves her switch it came in sooner than expected. 2 thumbs up.,Great timing
5,8-Jul-20,Overpriced but can’t find it any where else so sooo worth it! Love amazon!!,Worth it
5,7-Jul-20,Got it quick and it’s great,Awesome
5,7-Jul-20,Price was higher but we have been looking for months. We  finally caved after saving for awhile and paid the higher price tag. It was worth it. My fiance is happy. The Switch works perfectly. Thank you.,Supply and Demand. Great product just a higher tag.
5,6-Jul-20,"In the picture it shows the Nintendo switch, the left blue controller and the right red controller are the same height. It's showing a Nintendo switch but the launch version. After I purchase it I thought I bought the wrong one because when I checked back on the picture and it shows a picture of the older version. The newer version shows the right red controller sliding up a little bit. When the Nintendo switch arrived at my house I was happy to see that it was the correct one showing the right red controller sliding up. The Nintendo switch that shows the right red controller sliding up has an extra 23 hours of portable battery life. Definitely worth the $500. Even if it is an extra $200. You can't get mad at someone being smart enough to stock up to make a profit. at least it's not some of these people that are trying to sell them for $1000. I would suggest purchasing Super Mario Odyssey as a game to go with it. It also comes with a 32 gig micro SD card. The Nintendo switch only allows you to use certain micro SD cards. (32 gig micro SD HC is the one that comes with it) I normally would have probably bought the wrong memory card otherwise. My nephew is going to love it. Fun fact this is all because of a kid named Nate who created this thing called bird bot. Anytime as soon as a Nintendo switch was manufactured it would immediately be sold to whoever previously put their credit card info in using bird bot. Thanks Nate... #Nates_a_piece_of_shit_that_just_cost_me_an_extra_$200_but_I_ain't_mad_at_ya(2-Pac voice)",Don't wait till Christmas when it's a $1000 or sold out.
1,6-Jul-20,This is straight up price gouging. And the product could end up not working. If you don’t wanna pay an insane amount of extra money just wait.,Price gouging is horrible...

5,3-Jul-20,I bought this during the pandemic as a birthday gift for my 11 year old son. He wanted this game so much I paid more than double what it is worth but he was so happy he cried when we gave it to him. So for me it was worth it. It came new just as described. Came with memory card and works great. Thank u.,Worth it to me.
5,3-Jul-20,Shipped way faster then expected. Only took like 3 days. And it's the newer model that has a longer battery life FYI. I just played Animal Crossing on about 75% brightness for over 6 hours before the battery started getting critically low.,Shipped Fast!

I managed to buy mine at Best Buy for my girlfriend and it’s exactly what an animal crossing fan would love, aside from not including the game, which isn’t too bad because then you can decide if you want it physical for the cover art or digital without having to worry of loosing the game.

5,6-Sep-19,"This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)). So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while. I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings. So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime). Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.",Love the Switch - A Casual Gamer's Best Console
2,23-Aug-19,"Everything about the physical device, i feel like is pretty well made. Good set up, some minor future issues that are mitigated by screen protectors and similar. Several easy to work with ways to play it, kinda fun in its novelties on its build. My issue? 1) games are ridiculously expensive. So many are over priced. 2) Online play required by Nintendo for a not good service is poor. Especially for things like minecraft. 3) Where are any older games. The games that Nintendo has no need to keep out of the store. The old pokemon, Zelda games, or any games really. Like, great you are putting witcher 3 on there...But not Orignal Zelda and Ocherina of time? Physical? Great! Nintendo online and games? Bad. 1 or 2 games does not make the switch worth buying. PC has better prices, easier to work with, and you can play almost any game out there.",The device is great. The everything else is not.
